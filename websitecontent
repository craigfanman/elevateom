<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
Excluding business partners, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h3>Business Partners:</h3>
ElevateOM may share personal information with business partners. When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
 	<li>If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
Excluding business partners, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h4>Business Partners:</h4>
ElevateOM may share personal information with business partners. When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
 	<li>If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul>
If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.
If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Professional advisers some acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With&nbsp;a&nbsp;myriad of&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;channels&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;tools&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;today,&nbsp;you might not think&nbsp;it&nbsp;is still&nbsp;appropriate to&nbsp;consider emails&nbsp;and newsletters&nbsp;as&nbsp;digital&nbsp;assets.&nbsp;Sadly, you’d be wrong -&nbsp;good old&nbsp;email marketing is still an&nbsp;effective communication&nbsp;channel&nbsp;if&nbsp;you follow a few simple ideas that remain&nbsp;consistent with&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;your&nbsp;onlinemarketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What is a newsletter?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">How to create an effective newsletter</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make this form&nbsp;of&nbsp;communication our ally, however, we need a well-qualified database of recipients&nbsp;of&nbsp;which we have&nbsp;pre-authorisation to&nbsp;send marketing material,&nbsp;and which is preferably&nbsp;sub-divided by specific interests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Gather Contact Info</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be able to&nbsp;effectively begin sending your customers a&nbsp;newsletter, particular attention must be paid to&nbsp;how we gather&nbsp;contact&nbsp;information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create valuable newsletter content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create personalised content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody likes to receive generic and impersonal&nbsp;marketing material – it’ll soon land you in their spam box. Personalised&nbsp;newsletters are much more effective because they show the reader that you have taken the time to understand their needs and that you are interested in them as an individual. A mistake that is made all too often is to focus on what you want to say, rather than what customers&nbsp;really&nbsp;want to know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Encourage a call to action</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTAs (Call To Action) are an indispensable tool to get your readers to take action.&nbsp;Having a high email-open rate is certainly a great place to start, but the ultimate goal of a newsletter is to get results. Through the CTAs, customers can be invited to interact&nbsp;with your newsletter&nbsp;in&nbsp;ways that will lead to results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best&nbsp;way&nbsp;is to ask&nbsp;them&nbsp;to click on a link or on a button that takes&nbsp;them&nbsp;back to your site or your social accounts.&nbsp;Stay away from&nbsp;using phrases such as "Buy Now", which can appear as commands, it is better to&nbsp;use&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;such as "Find out more" which are&nbsp;more&nbsp;polite invitations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Use an email marketing platform</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a list and sending hundreds or thousands of emails manually is time-consuming and inefficient&nbsp;- this is where an email marketing platform comes in handy. They automate processes&nbsp;and&nbsp;offer&nbsp;detailed reports, customer segmentation options for sending targeted emails, and campaign management tools.&nbsp;These are essential if you want to increase the ROI of your email campaigns in an automated way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are numerous email marketing platforms and tools to choose from with different features, payment plans, and different levels of ease of use.</p>

<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

<p>To be able to&nbsp;effectively begin sending your customers a&nbsp;newsletter, particular attention must be paid to&nbsp;how we gather&nbsp;contact&nbsp;information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>

<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center">Create personalised content</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody likes to receive generic and impersonal&nbsp;marketing material – it’ll soon land you in their spam box. Personalised&nbsp;newsletters are much more effective because they show the reader that you have taken the time to understand their needs and that you are interested in them as an individual. A mistake that is made all too often is to focus on what you want to say, rather than what customers&nbsp;really&nbsp;want to know.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTAs (Call To Action) are an indispensable tool to get your readers to take action.&nbsp;Having a high email-open rate is certainly a great place to start, but the ultimate goal of a newsletter is to get results. Through the CTAs, customers can be invited to interact&nbsp;with your newsletter&nbsp;in&nbsp;ways that will lead to results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best&nbsp;way&nbsp;is to ask&nbsp;them&nbsp;to click on a link or on a button that takes&nbsp;them&nbsp;back to your site or your social accounts.&nbsp;Stay away from&nbsp;using phrases such as "Buy Now", which can appear as commands, it is better to&nbsp;use&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;such as "Find out more" which are&nbsp;more&nbsp;polite invitations.</p>

<p>Creating a list and sending hundreds or thousands of emails manually is time-consuming and inefficient&nbsp;- this is where an email marketing platform comes in handy.

<p>With&nbsp;a&nbsp;myriad of&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;channels&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;tools&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;today,&nbsp;you might not think&nbsp;it&nbsp;is still&nbsp;appropriate to&nbsp;consider emails&nbsp;and newsletters&nbsp;as&nbsp;digital&nbsp;assets.&nbsp;Sadly, you’d be wrong -&nbsp;good old&nbsp;email marketing is still an&nbsp;effective communication&nbsp;channel&nbsp;if&nbsp;you follow a few simple ideas that remain&nbsp;consistent with&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;your&nbsp;onlinemarketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What is a newsletter?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center">How to create an effective newsletter</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>To make this form&nbsp;of&nbsp;communication our ally, however, we need a well-qualified database of recipients&nbsp;of&nbsp;which we have&nbsp;pre-authorisation to&nbsp;send marketing material,&nbsp;and which is preferably&nbsp;sub-divided by specific interests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In nearly every&nbsp;business&nbsp;department, monthly and/or yearly reports form among the most important tools for&nbsp;assessing the performance of past&nbsp;strategies and campaigns&nbsp;with which to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;new ideas and make&nbsp;future&nbsp;business&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, digital marketing reports should form a fundamental aspect of your online marketing activities. They should be used to monitor advertising performance and ROI (Return On Investment), help you make sensible tweaks and changes to user experience and help understand the impact that your communication channels are having on your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's&nbsp;take a look at a few advantages&nbsp;of&nbsp;monthly&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing reporting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"27px"} -->
<div style="height:27px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h4>Assess&nbsp;KPIs&nbsp;and Objectives</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The analysis of KPIs, or&nbsp;<em>Key Performance Indicators</em>, allows you to understand the performance of a marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;with respect to the objectives you set for yourself and allows you to identify areas for improvement.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also&nbsp;allows you to fine-tune and&nbsp;act&nbsp;to&nbsp;correct&nbsp;issues&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here are just some of the main KPIs in Digital Marketing:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Page visits and mobile&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Conversion rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPC or the cost per click</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPL or the cost per lead</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPA or the cost per acquisition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;ROI or the return on investment</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KPIs are essential to understanding&nbsp;whether&nbsp;what you are doing&nbsp;is reaping&nbsp;the desired results or not&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;should,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;be drawn up&nbsp;at least&nbsp;monthly to evaluate&nbsp;whether KPIs&nbsp;align with&nbsp;the efforts and spending&nbsp;of&nbsp;various&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4>Get an overview of all&nbsp;marketing channels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best approach to achieving your marketing objectives is with a multi-channel marketing plan&nbsp;that enables you to&nbsp;interact and engage with your audience successfully regardless of&nbsp;where they are on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because&nbsp;data&nbsp;is often&nbsp;spread across several marketing platforms, multi-channel strategies can be challenging to administer. This issue is lessened by monthly marketing reporting, which combines metrics from several sources&nbsp;and collates&nbsp;them&nbsp;into a single, consolidated report. This&nbsp;means&nbsp;that you can evaluate the impact each channel has on the consumer experience&nbsp;and its&nbsp;effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing&nbsp;reports&nbsp;are a fundamental part of&nbsp;your&nbsp;marketing activities&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;shouldbe&nbsp;collated&nbsp;and available&nbsp;regularly -&nbsp;only&nbsp;then&nbsp;can you make&nbsp;concrete&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;on&nbsp;futureadvertising and communication&nbsp;activities.</p>

<h4>Assess&nbsp;KPIs&nbsp;and Objectives</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The analysis of KPIs, or&nbsp;<em>Key Performance Indicators</em>, allows you to understand the performance of a marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;with respect to the objectives you set for yourself and allows you to identify areas for improvement.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also&nbsp;allows you to fine-tune and&nbsp;act&nbsp;to&nbsp;correct&nbsp;issues&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here are just some of the main KPIs in Digital Marketing:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Page visits and mobile&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Conversion rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPC or the cost per click</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPL or the cost per lead</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPA or the cost per acquisition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;ROI or the return on investment</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KPIs are essential to understanding&nbsp;whether&nbsp;what you are doing&nbsp;is reaping&nbsp;the desired results or not&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;should,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;be drawn up&nbsp;at least&nbsp;monthly to evaluate&nbsp;whether KPIs&nbsp;align with&nbsp;the efforts and spending&nbsp;of&nbsp;various&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;campaigns.</p>

<h4>Get an overview of all&nbsp;marketing channels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best approach to achieving your marketing objectives is with a multi-channel marketing plan&nbsp;that enables you to&nbsp;interact and engage with your audience successfully regardless of&nbsp;where they are on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because&nbsp;data&nbsp;is often&nbsp;spread across several marketing platforms, multi-channel strategies can be challenging to administer. This issue is lessened by monthly marketing reporting, which combines metrics from several sources&nbsp;and collates&nbsp;them&nbsp;into a single, consolidated report. This&nbsp;means&nbsp;that you can evaluate the impact each channel has on the consumer experience&nbsp;and its&nbsp;effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing&nbsp;reports&nbsp;are a fundamental part of&nbsp;your&nbsp;marketing activities&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;shouldbe&nbsp;collated&nbsp;and available&nbsp;regularly -&nbsp;only&nbsp;then&nbsp;can you make&nbsp;concrete&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;on&nbsp;futureadvertising and communication&nbsp;activities.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;well-prepared&nbsp;SEO strategy for the Christmas season could mean the difference between succeeding or&nbsp;falling short&nbsp;of your goals&nbsp;over the festive season. Losing visibility, ranking lower on Google and driving away&nbsp;customers&nbsp;with poor content&nbsp;are&nbsp;the last things you want to happen during&nbsp;one of the busiest&nbsp;online shopping&nbsp;periods of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, we share some essential Christmas SEO optimisation tips to help you tweak your strategy ahead of this year’s Christmas season.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create useful SEO Christmas content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll&nbsp;have&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;that&nbsp;offline stores&nbsp;gradually start to adorn themselves in lights and ornaments&nbsp;as early as October to&nbsp;mid-November&nbsp;to get customers in the mood.&nbsp;Online, however, eCommerce&nbsp;retailers&nbsp;often mimic the holiday atmosphere&nbsp;weeks or months&nbsp;in advance&nbsp;by creating&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Content is&nbsp;king”&nbsp;in&nbsp;SEO marketing,&nbsp;and good&nbsp;SEO copywriting aims to produce content that meets the search needs of users and is optimised to be indexed by the Google algorithm and to scale the SERP. Writing new blog articles&nbsp;and&nbsp;promoting your&nbsp;festive&nbsp;products ahead of the&nbsp;2022 Christmas rush&nbsp;can help you climb the search rankings and increase traffic to your website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make use of Google Keyword Planner which can help you nail down what people are looking for so you can tailor your products and content to specific keywords each month. For example “Christmas cards" or even longer, but more specific keywords (long tail keywords) such as "local handmade Christmas cards”. These types of keywords are the ones that will generate the most traffic during the Christmas period.</p>

<h4>Black Friday Digital Marketing Strategies &amp; Tips</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The busiest online shopping weekend of the year is upon us – the Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday rush is among the most important time of the year for online stores. eCommerce and online businesses only have a short window of time to entice shoppers to take advantage of products and great offers from <em>their</em> websites among a dizzying array of competitors and flash deals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this successfully, however, it is necessary, as always, to set up an effective digital marketing strategy for maximising your advertising campaigns in terms of sales and ROAS (Return On Advertising Spend).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's have a look at some eCommerce strategies for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Plan Ahead</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not millions, but billions of promotional emails are sent in the run-up to Black Friday. This is the period when your emails will have to compete with many other brands and cut through the noise to get noticed. To be able to capture the attention of your potential customers you will need to mobilise ahead of time and plan carefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><strong>“Many retailers kick off their Black Friday sales promotion as early as the end of October, while others start promotions in early November.”</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pre-Black Friday is a crucial part of building an audience that is warmed up and prepared to buy when the time comes. Concentrate on those who are familiar with you, follow you, have seen your items, and have engaged with them. At the same time, it is also advisable to carry out a campaign on social networks or increase your ad budget to attract new potential buyers ahead of Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cold selling can be an added expense, especially for businesses with modest budgets. If you want to get noticed, the biggest piece of advice is to act early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Invest In Paid Search And Google Ads</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paid advertising campaigns are an effective eCommerce marketing strategy you can use to attract more customers this Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a recent study, almost half of all Black Friday deals are now decided by paid search advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While organic traffic is the best way to rank high on Google and other search engine results pages&nbsp;(SERPs), paid ads can be a game-changer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday eCommerce marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running PPC&nbsp;<em>(Pay Per Click)</em>&nbsp;ads in the days leading up to Black Friday weekend is an excellent marketing tool for increasing online traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Optimise your content and offers</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same goes for the use of keywords in your content. By relying on tools like Google Keyword Planners and Google Trends you can find the keywords to use in the descriptions and content of your site to maximise both the quality and quantity of your traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Content optimisation focuses on addressing issues in the following:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Internal links</li><li>Keywords</li><li>Featured snippets</li><li>URLs</li><li>Readability</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Send an E-Mail With Special Discounts</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although&nbsp;emails&nbsp;are one of the oldest forms of digital marketing, they should still be seen as valid and effective allies. Equally, everyone loves a special offer!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sending your contact list an email promising them a special discount will increase the anticipation when Black Friday arrives and gives them a reason to go and explore your products on offer in the hope of bagging a great deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't make discounts impossible and torturous to understand, however. Try to keep it simple, and be direct and immediate with your wording.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create a Black Friday landing page</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a landing page within your eCommerce site, entirely dedicated to grouping Black Friday offers is a great way to maintain your positioning within the SERP (the Google search results page) and thus ensures that users can find your products more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating&nbsp;specific content makes&nbsp;it easier for your audience to find you, especially those looking for offers. Make sure you create the page in advance of the big sale so that Googlebot has time to discover and index the page and its products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Retrieve abandoned carts with a personalised message and “one-time “offers</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sales naturally fall through the cracks, and a high cart abandonment rate is quite common for online retailers during Black Friday events. Optimising and recovering abandoned carts&nbsp;is and must for any eCommerce business not just during seasonal periods but as a normal part of your marketing strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a customer remarketing campaign can increase the chances of getting customers back to your site and completing the sales journey. Retargeting your visitors with a paid ad campaign allows you to bring them back to your store and back to the point of sale.</p>

<p>Pre-Black Friday is a crucial part of building an audience that is warmed up and prepared to buy when the time comes. Concentrate on those who are familiar with you, follow you, have seen your items, and have engaged with them. At the same time, it is also advisable to carry out a campaign on social networks or increase your ad budget to attract new potential buyers ahead of Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Invest In Paid Search And Google Ads</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paid advertising campaigns are an effective eCommerce marketing strategy you can use to attract more customers this Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a recent study, almost half of all Black Friday deals are now decided by paid search advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While organic traffic is the best way to rank high on Google and other search engine results pages&nbsp;(SERPs), paid ads can be a game-changer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday eCommerce marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running PPC <em>(Pay Per Click)</em> ads in the days leading up to Black Friday weekend is an excellent marketing tool for increasing online traffic.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":3} -->
<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Optimise your content and offers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same goes for the use of keywords in your content. By relying on tools like Google Keyword Planners and Google Trends you can find the keywords to use in the descriptions and content of your site to maximise both the quality and quantity of your traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Content optimisation focuses on addressing issues in the following:</strong></p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Send an E-Mail With Special Discounts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although&nbsp;emails&nbsp;are one of the oldest forms of digital marketing, they should still be seen as valid and effective allies. Equally, everyone loves a special offer!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sending your contact list an email promising them a special discount will increase the anticipation when Black Friday arrives and gives them a reason to go and explore your products on offer in the hope of bagging a great deal.</p>

<p>Don't make discounts impossible and torturous to understand, however. Try to keep it simple, and be direct and immediate with your wording.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Create a Black Friday landing page</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a landing page within your eCommerce site, entirely dedicated to grouping Black Friday offers is a great way to maintain your positioning within the SERP (the Google search results page) and thus ensures that users can find your products more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating specific content makes it easier for your audience to find you, especially those looking for offers. Make sure you create the page in advance of the big sale so that Googlebot has time to discover and index the page and its products.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sales naturally fall through the cracks, and a high cart abandonment rate is quite common for online retailers during Black Friday events. Optimising and recovering abandoned carts&nbsp;is and must for any eCommerce business not just during seasonal periods but as a normal part of your marketing strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a customer remarketing campaign can increase the chances of getting customers back to your site and completing the sales journey. Retargeting your visitors with a paid ad campaign allows you to bring them back to your store and back to the point of sale.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a sure-fire way to&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>get your local business noticed on search engines and create a virtual pathway to your front door – Local Paid Ads is where it's at. These ads allow potential customers to find your business quickly and easily on the Google Maps feature, aside from showing your business location, your ad will also display directions, your business phone number and address - generating leads via telephone, website enquires or foot traffic to your premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've all got a smart phone in our pocket these days, with over 80% of online users searching via their mobile device, making Google Maps the ultimate feature, particularly when it comes to searching for businesses on the go. Research proves that the Google Maps "near me" function is highly successful in capturing a user’s attention, allowing them to locate businesses such as yours nearest to their location - whatever industry they may be looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local Paid Ads are the<em>&nbsp;ultimate</em>&nbsp;way to ensure your business ranks highly on Google Maps listings and are hugely effective in promoting your products or services to that local "ready to buy" audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's no secret that Video Marketing is booming, so to&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>make your business stand out, drive traffic, and increase leads, we'll integrate a video into your local listing which will show up in search results along with all your other business details. But don't worry if you don't have a video for your business, we can create an infographic video just for you as an add on to this service.&nbsp;</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is one of, if not, the most important internet marketing methods for growing your online business. It not only supports search engine algorithms in accurately indexing web pages but also enhances user experience. SEO can also greatly increase organic traffic and continuously improve your site's rating in the SERP (Search Engine Results Pages).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, If you’re just not getting the traction you need or you’ve noticed a sudden decline in rankings and visitors then some, or all of the below SEO mistakes could be to blame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's look at 5 common mistakes you can address right now to improve website SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor Titles And Descriptions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay close attention to your title and description tags, especially on your home page or high traffic pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your description (which usually appears as the snippet below the link to your site in search results) should entice people to click on your results, letting searchers know that the site provides an answer to their query or is a good resource. If not, you may want to optimise the meta description and experiment with them on high traffic pages to see what the best result is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you stuff your content with keywords; by stuffing, we mean high volume stuffing; you risk not just being perceived as spam by your readers, but you also risk getting penalised by Google.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword stuffing comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but it usually involves repeating a phrase or term (often robotically) in your content over and over to rank better on Google – this doesn’t work and Google upped its game a long time ago to combat this practice. We strongly advise against this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The importance of link building</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proper usage of backlinks and link building efforts allows a company’s website to be optimised and move up the SERP. External links boost the authority of a website and are rewarded by Google. When this element is overlooked, you run the risk of your position dropping over time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presence of links within your content (backlinks) allows the site to be organised and structured hierarchically, improving both the end user's and search engine's navigability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the subject of links; broken links on your website can also contribute to problems, theynot only affect the user experience but also make it more difficult for search engines to index your site. When it comes to increasing website traffic and rankings, locating and fixingbroken links on your website is crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Slow website speed</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common SEO mistakes that leads to a high bounce rate is slow website speed. No one in today's fast-paced world wants to wait for a website to load. This means that if your website's loading time is too slow, it may be affecting its performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google is clear that page speed is a ranking factor for searches performed on websites and mobile devices</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking your website's speed can assist you in figuring out why it's so slow. Various free online tools will also give you advice on how to properly tackle these issues in lowering your bounce rate and clawing back your rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor content or copying content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may sound obvious, but if you're copying content from other sources then it’s most likely that Google isn't going to place you anywhere near the top of page rankings. Google is smart; and utilises automatic systems to score websites based on a range of characteristics, one of which is detecting copied content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equally, you’re not going to improve your organic SEO this way, and if the plagiarism is substantial, you may be reported to Google's DMC. Not the best way to approach SEO!Creating new content and updating existing articles is a good way to build upon and improve your SEO.</p>

<p>All online businesses, especially small to medium-sized ones, can benefit from a welcome boost in advertising with PPC (Pay Per Click) marketing campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A successful PPC marketing campaign can yield greater interactions and profits in a shorter time than many other online or local marketing campaigns. It is the ideal method for fast, quality traffic and conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">PPC Advertising - The Basics&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is a marketing channel where you, the advertiser, pays a certain amountevery time one of your promotional ads is clicked. Effectively, it's a way of buying visits to your site, rather than obtaining them organically via SEO or content marketing, which when combined, can serve as a great, all-encompassing digital marketing strategy. In time, PPC campaigns will make a great contribution to the growth of your online business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take a look at a few main advantages of this form of digital advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Reach The Right Audience</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During a PPC campaign, you can choose exactly when and where your ads will appear based on a range of parameters such as location, website, keywords, time, data, device and many others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can then show your business ads to a very specific and engaged audience, increasing the quality of traffic on your website. This kind of adaptability allows you to segment your market and reach the proper demographic, giving you the visibility you need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">More Immediate results</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPC advertising is the fastest way to create a promotional campaign and achieve results in a short period of time. If you have an existing business website, all you need to do is create ads and run them on the best platforms to increase website traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is very different from an SEO campaign, which often requires a lot of time and attention to get the same type of positioning and traffic offered by Google Ads in the short term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Gives You Total Control</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPC also gives you added control of your over your campaign clearly and measurably; you can measure virtually everything related to your PPC campaign, including revenues, costs, clicks, views, visits, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As highlighted previously, thanks to this form of advertising, you pay only when a user clicks on your ad, visits your website or landing page. You'll know <em>exactly</em> how much you're spending from the minute you start your PPC campaign. Statistics and data are easily accessible, displaying the success of your campaigns, the sort of traffic they are driving, and the results they are producing in comparison to the initial budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Useful Data And Audience Insights</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The data and information provided on Google Ads have significance that extends well beyond the performance of a PPC campaign. Each keyword's impression, click, and conversion data can be used to further improve upon existing SEO and content marketing strategies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Geographic Relevance</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, pay-per-click is an excellent method for audience segmentation. It allows businesses to concentrate their efforts on a certain geographic location; i.e. local PPC campaigns. Many businesses who operate in a small geographic area find that advertising across the country is a waste of money and resources; instead, it would be much better to be able to have their ads displayed <strong><em>only</em></strong> to users in a specific area of operation.</p>

<h4><em>THE ART OF BEING A SOCIAL (MEDIA) BUTTERFLY</em></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From big brands to start-ups, every business at some point will embark on a social media campaign, no matter how big or small. And, It's impossible to have a digital strategy without mentioning “social networks”- from Facebook to Instagram, Twitter to YouTube, one thing is for sure; get it right and there is boundless potential to connect with huge audiences and reap great rewards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But…yes, but! There are certain things to bear in mind when dabbling in the social realm and, more importantly, a few things <em>to do</em> and <em>not to do </em>to be successful. Let’s take a look at a few to get you started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Be Active!</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be lively and present on your socials to help give your digital reputation a boost. Start conversations with your followers, ask them what they think about a product, help them solve a product issue or simply provide free advice. All this will connect you to the people you want to be connected to while also gaining great insight into what people like about your products and services. However, when engaging with your followers, you also need to be prepared to handle negative feedback as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Show Your Strengths</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emphasise your company's distinct features and benefits. Be proud of your product or the level of service you provide. This will show current and new clients how proud you are of your company and, more importantly, how beneficial it would be for them to add you to their network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Analyse your social media data</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don't keep track of your social media analytics, how will you know what's working and what isn’t? You should check your analytics at least once a week to make sure you are on track to beat your previous month/year’s performance or find new ways to increase poor performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Check out what your competitors are up to</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing what your competitors do allows you to compare your social media strategy with theirs. Think of it as free advice - If they are performing better than you in terms of engagement, you can change your strategy and make it more effective. Likewise, if your competitor is doing badly, you can understand what <em>not to do</em> to fall into the same trap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Don’t be boring!</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Don’t be boring; perhaps this is a bit of tough love, perhaps it’s obvious. One thing is for sure, it’s all too easy to become static and monotonous over time on social media. The first rule is to be daring and creative; experiment, play with ideas, study your audience, find out what they like best and what they don't, don't insist on the same type of content if it only ever gets the same few likes. Win the hearts of new users and build loyalty in your community by changing things often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t recycle post across the same socials</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all content is suitable for all social networks. A post that is successful on one may not experience the same on Facebook or Instagram, for example. Adapt your tone of voice and hone your strategy to achieve the best across all your channels.</p>

<p>With thousands of videos uploaded to YouTube every day, how can you be sure your video stands out from the crowd?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is the second most used search engine in the world after Google and, for this reason, it has become an indispensable tool for digital marketing and increasing brand awareness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Video content, if thoughtfully produced can be hugely entertaining and informative; it can help explain the advantages of your products and services more completely and comprehensively, improve your brand reputation, and ultimately improve your ranking on Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The video content you produce is always inextricably linked to your SEO campaign because videos allow you to improve your SEO positioning on search engines. This is why it becomes essential to understand a few key techniques that can help you optimise your videos to appear among the first results in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) and generate conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we’ll share a few tips to help you optimise your video content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Choose the right hosting platform</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO specialists agree on one thing: Google loves video! And, optimisation starts with choosing the hosting platform for your video. If the purpose of the video marketing strategy is to increase your brand awareness and search engine rankings then YouTube and Vimeo aresolid choices to consider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is certainly the best to go with for optimising videos for SEO, just like a search engine, it uses many of the same algorithms and ranking factors as Google does.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Video Transcripts for SEO&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good video should, ideally, also have a descriptive transcript of the visual content. The transcription is nothing more than the text without the audio which can be used for closed captioning (cc).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only this but building relevant keywords into the transcriptions allows Google and Youtube algorithms to understand the content of the video and place it in the SERP: this alone should make it clear how important the transcription is not just for the user, but also YoutubeSEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Enticing and engaging cover image</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A user is first drawn by the cover image, which is the first frame they see when they find the video content in a search result. It must therefore be relevant, of good quality and perfectly visible and recognisable to the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google loves rich content with a mix of text, photos, and videos, particularly rich content that addresses search intent and keeps users engaged on the website for an extended period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Title and descriptions</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always remember to take care of the title and meta-description as if it were a real blog article: they play a very important role even for video marketing. So, the headline keywords must appear in the title, in the description and most importantly, in the tags.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The title and description of your video should address a few things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>a) Tell people what your video is about (<em>briefly</em>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>b) Make it interesting enough to click on</p>

<p>With thousands of videos uploaded to YouTube every day, how can you be sure your video stands out from the crowd?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is the second most used search engine in the world after Google and, for this reason, it has become an indispensable tool for digital marketing and increasing brand awareness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Five hundred minutes of video uploaded to YouTube every minute equates to approximately 30,000 hours of video uploaded every hour”</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Video content, if thoughtfully produced can be hugely entertaining and informative; it can help explain the advantages of your products and services more completely and comprehensively, improve your brand reputation, and ultimately improve your ranking on Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The video content you produce is always inextricably linked to your SEO campaign because videos allow you to improve your SEO positioning on search engines. This is why it becomes essential to understand a few key techniques that can help you optimise your videos to appear among the first results in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) and generate conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we’ll share a few tips to help you optimise your video content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose the right hosting platform</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO specialists agree on one thing: Google loves video! And, optimisation starts with choosing the hosting platform for your video. If the purpose of the video marketing strategy is to increase your brand awareness and search engine rankings then YouTube and Vimeo aresolid choices to consider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is certainly the best to go with for optimising videos for SEO, just like a search engine, it uses many of the same algorithms and ranking factors as Google does.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Video Transcripts for SEO&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good video should, ideally, also have a descriptive transcript of the visual content. The transcription is nothing more than the text without the audio which can be used for closed captioning (cc).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only this but building relevant keywords into the transcriptions allows Google and Youtube algorithms to understand the content of the video and place it in the SERP: this alone should make it clear how important the transcription is not just for the user, but also YoutubeSEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enticing and engaging cover image</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A user is first drawn by the cover image, which is the first frame they see when they find the video content in a search result. It must therefore be relevant, of good quality and perfectly visible and recognisable to the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google loves rich content with a mix of text, photos, and videos, particularly rich content that addresses search intent and keeps users engaged on the website for an extended period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Title and descriptions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always remember to take care of the title and meta-description as if it were a real blog article: they play a very important role even for video marketing. So, the headline keywords must appear in the title, in the description and most importantly, in the tags.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The title and description of your video should address a few things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>a) Tell people what your video is about (<em>briefly</em>)</p>

<p><em>How do you protect your website?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's easy to assume that no one would be interested in hacking your website if you run a small or medium-sized business. Afterall, the majority of hackers do, in fact, target huge corporations or government entities. However, any website can be hacked into in a variety of ways, and cyber-criminals are always on the lookout for easy prey, from obscure blogs to eCommerce sites – either way, website hacks can be extremely damaging to any company's reputation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at a few staggering statistics which will put into perspective just how prevalent website hacks and vulnerabilities are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->

<p>So, what security measures can you implement to defend your website from hacks and cyber-attacks?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While protecting your website from hackers may appear daunting, there are steps you can take to drastically mitigate the dangers. A substantial percentage of attacks are aimed at easy targets, and hackers frequently ignore sites that show strong resistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To stay safe, keep your software up to date and under constant surveillance. Make sure you're always aware of new security updates, check components/plugins you're utilising in your web apps and that you're removing those that aren't in use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the most effective thing you can do to ensure your website is up to date, being monitored, and safely backed up is to choose a reputable webmaster or hosting company to protect your website from hackers and free from malicious attacks.</p>

<p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is one of, if not, the most important internet marketing methods for growing your online business. It not only supports search engine algorithms in accurately indexing web pages but also enhances user experience. SEO can also greatly increase organic traffic and continuously improve your site's rating in the SERP (Search Engine Results Pages).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, If you’re just not getting the traction you need or you’ve noticed a sudden decline in rankings and visitors then some, or all of the below SEO mistakes could be to blame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's look at 5 common mistakes you can address right now to improve website SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor Titles And Descriptions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay close attention to your title and description tags, especially on your home page or high traffic pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your description (which usually appears as the snippet below the link to your site in search results) should entice people to click on your results, letting searchers know that the site provides an answer to their query or is a good resource. If not, you may want to optimise the meta description and experiment with them on high traffic pages to see what the best result is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you stuff your content with keywords; by stuffing, we mean high volume stuffing; you risk not just being perceived as spam by your readers, but you also risk getting penalised by Google.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword stuffing comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but it usually involves repeating a phrase or term (often robotically) in your content over and over to rank better on Google – this doesn’t work and Google upped its game a long time ago to combat this practice. We strongly advise against this.</p>

<p><strong>The importance of link building</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proper usage of backlinks and link building efforts allows a company’s website to be optimised and move up the SERP. External links boost the authority of a website and are rewarded by Google. When this element is overlooked, you run the risk of your position dropping over time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presence of links within your content (backlinks) allows the site to be organised and structured hierarchically, improving both the end user's and search engine's navigability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the subject of links; broken links on your website can also contribute to problems, theynot only affect the user experience but also make it more difficult for search engines to index your site. When it comes to increasing website traffic and rankings, locating and fixingbroken links on your website is crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Slow website speed</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common SEO mistakes that leads to a high bounce rate is slow website speed. No one in today's fast-paced world wants to wait for a website to load. This means that if your website's loading time is too slow, it may be affecting its performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google is clear that page speed is a ranking factor for searches performed on websites and mobile devices</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking your website's speed can assist you in figuring out why it's so slow. Various free online tools will also give you advice on how to properly tackle these issues in lowering your bounce rate and clawing back your rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor content or copying content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may sound obvious, but if you're copying content from other sources then it’s most likely that Google isn't going to place you anywhere near the top of page rankings. Google is smart; and utilises automatic systems to score websites based on a range of characteristics, one of which is detecting copied content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equally, you’re not going to improve your organic SEO this way, and if the plagiarism is substantial, you may be reported to Google's DMC. Not the best way to approach SEO!Creating new content and updating existing articles is a good way to build upon and improve your SEO.</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All online businesses, especially small to medium-sized ones, can benefit from a welcome boost in advertising with PPC (Pay Per Click) marketing campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A successful PPC marketing campaign can yield greater interactions and profits in a shorter time than many other online or local marketing campaigns. It is the ideal method for fast, quality traffic and conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">PPC Advertising - The Basics&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is a marketing channel where you, the advertiser, pays a certain amountevery time one of your promotional ads is clicked. Effectively, it's a way of buying visits to your site, rather than obtaining them organically via SEO or content marketing, which when combined, can serve as a great, all-encompassing digital marketing strategy. In time, PPC campaigns will make a great contribution to the growth of your online business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take a look at a few main advantages of this form of digital advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Reach The Right Audience</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During a PPC campaign, you can choose exactly when and where your ads will appear based on a range of parameters such as location, website, keywords, time, data, device and many others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can then show your business ads to a very specific and engaged audience, increasing the quality of traffic on your website. This kind of adaptability allows you to segment your market and reach the proper demographic, giving you the visibility you need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">More Immediate results</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPC advertising is the fastest way to create a promotional campaign and achieve results in a short period of time. If you have an existing business website, all you need to do is create ads and run them on the best platforms to increase website traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is very different from an SEO campaign, which often requires a lot of time and attention to get the same type of positioning and traffic offered by Google Ads in the short term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Gives You Total Control</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PPC also gives you added control of your over your campaign clearly and measurably; you can measure virtually everything related to your PPC campaign, including revenues, costs, clicks, views, visits, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As highlighted previously, thanks to this form of advertising, you pay only when a user clicks on your ad, visits your website or landing page. You'll know <em>exactly</em> how much you're spending from the minute you start your PPC campaign. Statistics and data are easily accessible, displaying the success of your campaigns, the sort of traffic they are driving, and the results they are producing in comparison to the initial budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Useful Data And Audience Insights</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The data and information provided on Google Ads have significance that extends well beyond the performance of a PPC campaign. Each keyword's impression, click, and conversion data can be used to further improve upon existing SEO and content marketing strategies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Geographic Relevance</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, pay-per-click is an excellent method for audience segmentation. It allows businesses to concentrate their efforts on a certain geographic location; i.e. local PPC campaigns. Many businesses who operate in a small geographic area find that advertising across the country is a waste of money and resources; instead, it would be much better to be able to have their ads displayed <strong><em>only</em></strong> to users in a specific area of operation.</p>

<h4><em>THE ART OF BEING A SOCIAL (MEDIA) BUTTERFLY</em></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From big brands to start-ups, every business at some point will embark on a social media campaign, no matter how big or small. And, It's impossible to have a digital strategy without mentioning “social networks”- from Facebook to Instagram, Twitter to YouTube, one thing is for sure; get it right and there is boundless potential to connect with huge audiences and reap great rewards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But…yes, but! There are certain things to bear in mind when dabbling in the social realm and, more importantly, a few things <em>to do</em> and <em>not to do </em>to be successful. Let’s take a look at a few to get you started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Be Active!</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be lively and present on your socials to help give your digital reputation a boost. Start conversations with your followers, ask them what they think about a product, help them solve a product issue or simply provide free advice. All this will connect you to the people you want to be connected to while also gaining great insight into what people like about your products and services. However, when engaging with your followers, you also need to be prepared to handle negative feedback as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Show Your Strengths</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emphasise your company's distinct features and benefits. Be proud of your product or the level of service you provide. This will show current and new clients how proud you are of your company and, more importantly, how beneficial it would be for them to add you to their network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Analyse your social media data</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don't keep track of your social media analytics, how will you know what's working and what isn’t? You should check your analytics at least once a week to make sure you are on track to beat your previous month/year’s performance or find new ways to increase poor performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5>Check out what your competitors are up to</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing what your competitors do allows you to compare your social media strategy with theirs. Think of it as free advice - If they are performing better than you in terms of engagement, you can change your strategy and make it more effective. Likewise, if your competitor is doing badly, you can understand what <em>not to do</em> to fall into the same trap.</p>

<h5>Don’t be boring!</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Don’t be boring; perhaps this is a bit of tough love, perhaps it’s obvious. One thing is for sure, it’s all too easy to become static and monotonous over time on social media. The first rule is to be daring and creative; experiment, play with ideas, study your audience, find out what they like best and what they don't, don't insist on the same type of content if it only ever gets the same few likes. Win the hearts of new users and build loyalty in your community by changing things often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t recycle post across the same socials</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all content is suitable for all social networks. A post that is successful on one may not experience the same on Facebook or Instagram, for example. Adapt your tone of voice and hone your strategy to achieve the best across all your channels.</p>

<p>With thousands of videos uploaded to YouTube every day, how can you be sure your video stands out from the crowd?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is the second most used search engine in the world after Google and, for this reason, it has become an indispensable tool for digital marketing and increasing brand awareness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>“Five hundred minutes of video uploaded to YouTube every minute equates to approximately 30,000 hours of video uploaded every hour”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/youtube-stats/#youtube-usage-statistics">https://www.semrush.com/blog/youtube-stats/#youtube-usage-statistics</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Video content, if thoughtfully produced can be hugely entertaining and informative; it can help explain the advantages of your products and services more completely and comprehensively, improve your brand reputation, and ultimately improve your ranking on Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The video content you produce is always inextricably linked to your SEO campaign because videos allow you to improve your SEO positioning on search engines. This is why it becomes essential to understand a few key techniques that can help you optimise your videos to appear among the first results in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) and generate conversions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we’ll share a few tips to help you optimise your video content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Choose the right hosting platform</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO specialists agree on one thing: Google loves video! And, optimisation starts with choosing the hosting platform for your video. If the purpose of the video marketing strategy is to increase your brand awareness and search engine rankings then YouTube and Vimeo aresolid choices to consider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is certainly the best to go with for optimising videos for SEO, just like a search engine, it uses many of the same algorithms and ranking factors as Google does.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Video Transcripts for SEO&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good video should, ideally, also have a descriptive transcript of the visual content. The transcription is nothing more than the text without the audio which can be used for closed captioning (cc).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only this but building relevant keywords into the transcriptions allows Google and Youtube algorithms to understand the content of the video and place it in the SERP: this alone should make it clear how important the transcription is not just for the user, but also YoutubeSEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Enticing and engaging cover image</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A user is first drawn by the cover image, which is the first frame they see when they find the video content in a search result. It must therefore be relevant, of good quality and perfectly visible and recognisable to the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google loves rich content with a mix of text, photos, and videos, particularly rich content that addresses search intent and keeps users engaged on the website for an extended period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Title and descriptions</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always remember to take care of the title and meta-description as if it were a real blog article: they play a very important role even for video marketing. So, the headline keywords must appear in the title, in the description and most importantly, in the tags.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The title and description of your video should address a few things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>a) Tell people what your video is about (<em>briefly</em>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>b) Make it interesting enough to click on</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>c) Point people in other relevant directions.</p>

<p><em>How do you protect your website?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's easy to assume that no one would be interested in hacking your website if you run a small or medium-sized business. Afterall, the majority of hackers do, in fact, target huge corporations or government entities. However, any website can be hacked into in a variety of ways, and cyber-criminals are always on the lookout for easy prey, from obscure blogs to eCommerce sites – either way, website hacks can be extremely damaging to any company's reputation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at a few staggering statistics which will put into perspective just how prevalent website hacks and vulnerabilities are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>• Google blacklists around 20,000 websites each week and alerts another 50,000 for malware, on average 30,000 new websites are hacked every day. (Source: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day-how-do-you-host-yours/?sh=6703ef751738">Forbes</a>)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>• The volume of malware threats observed by McAfee Labs averaged 688 threats per minute, an increase of 40 threats per minute (3%) in the first quarter of 2021. (Source: <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-threats-jun-2021.pdf">McAfee</a>)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>• At least one backdoor was found on 47 % of all hacked websites. A backdoor is a security flaw that allows hackers to gain access to a website. (Source: <a href="https://sucuri.net/reports/2019-hacked-website-report/">Sucuri</a> )</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>• Around 300,000 new pieces of malware are created daily to target individuals and companies. (Source <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-cyber-attacks-per-day/">TechJury</a>)</em></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what security measures can you implement to defend your website from hacks and cyber-attacks?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While protecting your website from hackers may appear daunting, there are steps you can take to drastically mitigate the dangers. A substantial percentage of attacks are aimed at easy targets, and hackers frequently ignore sites that show strong resistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To stay safe, keep your software up to date and under constant surveillance. Make sure you're always aware of new security updates, check components/plugins you're utilising in your web apps and that you're removing those that aren't in use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the most effective thing you can do to ensure your website is up to date, being monitored, and safely backed up is to choose a reputable webmaster or hosting company to protect your website from hackers and free from malicious attacks.</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is one of, if not, the most important internet marketing methods for growing your online business. It not only supports search engine algorithms in accurately indexing web pages but also enhances user experience. SEO can also greatly increase organic traffic and continuously improve your site's rating in the SERP (Search Engine Results Pages).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, If you’re just not getting the traction you need or you’ve noticed a sudden decline in rankings and visitors then some, or all of the below SEO mistakes could be to blame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's look at 5 common mistakes you can address right now to improve website SEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor Titles And Descriptions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pay close attention to your title and description tags, especially on your home page or high traffic pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your description (which usually appears as the snippet below the link to your site in search results) should entice people to click on your results, letting searchers know that the site provides an answer to their query or is a good resource. If not, you may want to optimise the meta description and experiment with them on high traffic pages to see what the best result is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Keyword Stuffing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you stuff your content with keywords; by stuffing, we mean high volume stuffing; you risk not just being perceived as spam by your readers, but you also risk getting penalised by Google.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword stuffing comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but it usually involves repeating a phrase or term (often robotically) in your content over and over to rank better on Google – this doesn’t work and Google upped its game a long time ago to combat this practice. We strongly advise against this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The importance of link building</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proper usage of backlinks and link building efforts allows a company’s website to be optimised and move up the SERP. External links boost the authority of a website and are rewarded by Google. When this element is overlooked, you run the risk of your position dropping over time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presence of links within your content (backlinks) allows the site to be organised and structured hierarchically, improving both the end user's and search engine's navigability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the subject of links; broken links on your website can also contribute to problems, theynot only affect the user experience but also make it more difficult for search engines to index your site. When it comes to increasing website traffic and rankings, locating and fixingbroken links on your website is crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Slow website speed</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common SEO mistakes that leads to a high bounce rate is slow website speed. No one in today's fast-paced world wants to wait for a website to load. This means that if your website's loading time is too slow, it may be affecting its performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google is clear that page speed is a ranking factor for searches performed on websites and mobile devices</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking your website's speed can assist you in figuring out why it's so slow. Various free online tools will also give you advice on how to properly tackle these issues in lowering your bounce rate and clawing back your rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Poor content or copying content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may sound obvious, but if you're copying content from other sources then it’s most likely that Google isn't going to place you anywhere near the top of page rankings. Google is smart; and utilises automatic systems to score websites based on a range of characteristics, one of which is detecting copied content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equally, you’re not going to improve your organic SEO this way, and if the plagiarism is substantial, you may be reported to Google's DMC. Not the best way to approach SEO!Creating new content and updating existing articles is a good way to build upon and improve your SEO.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Professional advisers some acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
<h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
<h2>3. How is your personal data collected?</h2>

<ul>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.

 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

SEO can get rather complicated, especially for those who are new to digital marketing.

While shopping for SEO services online, you have probably seen a range of SEO companies.

An SEO company provides search engine optimisation services to businesses and organisations to help them improve their visibility online.
Search engine optimisation involves making changes to your website design and content to make your site more attractive to the search engines. The better optimised your site is for search engines like Google, the more likely your site will be to rank on the first page of the search engine results for keywords and phrases that are relevant to what your business, product or service is offering.
SEO experts know what it takes to help you bring more organic and natural traffic to your site through search engines like Google and Yahoo.
There SEO experts in different areas of search engine optimisation who provide a range of services including but not limited to:

•	Auditing your site
•	Developing a tailored SEO strategy
•	Implementing the tactics and strategies that will help your business reach its goals

A lot of people think the main benefit of employing someone for SEO services is to increase the amount of traffic to their site. However, did you know they can also increase the quality of traffic to your site?  If your site is ranking for keywords and phrases that accurately align with your product or service offering that means the traffic that you are bringing to your site is more relevant.
As you bring more relevant traffic to your site, you increase your chances of influencing conversions. That is because the people who are coming to your site are more likely to be interested in your products or services.
SEO Experts provide you with tangible measurable results. You can literally see the benefits and the return on your investment. If you’re looking to make the most of your business in 2019, why not try and increase your audience using tried and tested SEO techniques."
"Which Social Media Platform is Most Effective for your Business? How Social Media Management can Help your Business

The number of platforms out there can feel overwhelming for any business. So is Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and twitter social media management right for your firm?

There are lots of different types of social media out there now and it’s important to understand which is going to be more effective for your business. Social media management will ensure you’re using the right platform for your target audience.

By being on social media, you make your business or organisation more discoverable. This leads to a more natural likelihood to being found by new potential customers. It also allows you to build and cultivate great and natural relationships with your customers. Social media is perfect for building a brand and showing your company’s personality. Not only will this bring you new followers and customers but it will also widen your recruitment pool. Like minded people will see your work and realise you foster the kind of environment they want to work in.

Before deciding where to focus your social media management efforts, you need to decide a plan. What do you want from these services? By establishing these objectives, you can save time, money and resources by focusing on achieving these goals.

Figure out who exactly you’re trying to reach and clearly outline your target audience. Make it as specific as possible: age, location, interests and many more factors are relevant in working to meet your goals. This allows you to narrow down which platforms are right for your audience.

Once you’ve determined what you’re doing and who you’re doing it for, it’s time to decide on your brand’s tone and online personality. Are you a fun company or more formal? Do you want to share memes or just focus on the products themselves? Different companies have different answers to these questions and it’s important to think about.

Plan your content. If your brand is something that naturally lends itself to visual marketing, instagram might be the ideal place for you. No matter where you focus your efforts, ensure the posts are scheduled and regular. It is so important to be consistent on these sites as it not only builds better relationships with potential customers but also makes your content more attractive to the algorithm and ensures more people see it.

Whether you’re just starting out with social media marketing or are looking to reconsider your strategy, social media management can take the stress and hassle out of this for you."
"We all know that providing excellent customer service is a key factor for a successful business. This blog post aims to offer you online business customer service tips and tricks so you make the most of what the internet has to offer your organisation.

To provide great service, you need to know your product or service well. Be aware of the types of questions your customers are likely to ask and ensure you and all your customer facing staff have all the answers and answers to follow up questions.

Make sure you’re friendly. Even when handling issues entirely online, keep your tone on any emails as personable and professional as possible. If you work on the phone, make sure you smile while chatting. It can really change the tone of your voice and make you seem a lot happier to deal with your clients.

Make sure your staff understand what you expect from them. Ensure you have a consistent tone, way of speaking and way of interacting with customers. Even if a staff member is unlikely to interact with customers, they should still be aware of the expectations. This sets the entire company up for success.
Customer service is often emotional. Your clients deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. Be respectful throughout any interactions even if you feel frustrated or upset. It is vital you keep your client happy. Further to this, make sure you’re responding to the clients’ needs, frustrations and queries. Answer emails quickly and try to get back to clients as quickly as possible.

Ask for feedback, both negative and positive. This shows you exactly what you’re doing right and the issues you need to improve upon. It is vital that you act on this feedback. Knowing that clients are frustrated with the time it takes to get a response is only important if you’re planning to rectify this issue.

By ensuring your customer service is excellent, your company can retain clients even if there are issues. This is why it is vital that you are able to work and adapt to keep your customers as happy as possible."
"The benefits of mobile friendly sites cannot be overstated. More people than ever before use their mobile devices or tablets as their primary way to access the internet. Almost 50% of purchases made online in 2019 are made using a mobile device. That’s a huge number of people that you could be shutting out of your business by not having a website that is inviting to all users.

A well-executed responsive website design will ensure that navigation and images adapt well to the mobile experience. On mobile, the text becomes even more important because of the limited space available. When writing content for your mobile site, strive to be concise, purposeful, and readable with headers and callouts to help your reader quickly navigate your site's information. Remember to keep your calls to action especially prominent on mobile with easy-to-read buttons or call outs.

In addition to just being generally frustrating, not having a mobile friendly site can negatively affect your website’s SEO ranking. This means that even the people trying to find you on a computer won’t necessarily be able to find you. Most companies aren’t willing to throw away an audience of 50% of buyers but even if you were, this negative effect on your ranking can cause you to lose other customers too.

Create a streamlined and consistent experience across all devices by ensuring your mobile site looks fantastic! This allows your brand to be instantly recognisable and more likely to complete conversions.

Mobile friendliness is great for your business. No ifs ands or buts. Using a mobile friendly, responsive web design can increase your search engine rankings by 77.59% according to one study. Making your site attractive allows mobile users to stay on longer, which makes them more likely to follow on your call to action.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to grow your business and don’t throw away vital clients. Adapt to the changing world and use all the tools at your disposal to make your organisation as appealing as possible."
"All of us could count ourselves as social media marketers. Whether we’re freelancers, have a side-hustle we share with our friends on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter or you have a page for our business, it counts. Therefore, it makes sense for us to utilise our social media presence in the same way big brands do!

Instagram is a great platform for businesses as it offers a huge level of support for brands and, due to the sheer number of Instagram influencers, there are opportunities to access targeted audiences that can meet your brand’s niche.

This blog aims to offer you a guide on how to use Instagram in a way that can truly benefit your business.

Firstly, ensure your feed has a cohesive, consistent look. We all know about how important it is for our business to curate a brand but many businesses don’t apply that same philosophy to their social media pages. Use presets or specific filters to give all of your photos a similar feel and ensure your content is posted consistently.

It’s important for you to actually be a part of the community. For example, if you are a kitchenware brand, involve yourself in the cooking side of Instagram. Connect and engage with people by following, liking and commenting but ensure it stays authentic. People don’t like phony brands and can spot them from a mile away. Don’t forget to integrate community created content in your feed. It shows you value you your customers, your followers and your fans.

As mentioned previously, Instagram is probably the most supportive social media platform for brands and it’s important to take advantage! Instagram is where your base and your customers are so it’s vital to seize the opportunity. If you’re selling goods, ensure you’re using the shoppable posts feature. Make sure your images a beautiful, clear and that your account is linked to an active Facebook account.

Make sure you’re organised. Create a content calendar that allows you to prepare posts for big sales, holidays or events and even just keep your day to day posting consistent. Front-load this work so you can release these posts when they’re most effective.

Using templates is another great way to ensure consistency throughout your platforms. These are created by professionals so can help you get a coherent look throughout your posts even if you don’t have an artistic eye and allows you to change the aspect ratio for posting to different mediums.

Hashtags are a fantastic way to find your niche and expand your reach on Instagram. You can also create a specific hashtag, encourage your followers to post with that same hashtag and allow the community to go viral without doing 100% of the work."
"No matter what a business does, the most important thing, in terms of marketing success, to determine is your target audience. This allows you to find the most appropriate and effective strategy, tailored to your desired demographic through content, SEO, web design and social media.

According to research, people are drawn to marketing that is personable and more human. Despite all of this, many marketers will barrel ahead with a strategy that guesses what their target market wants rather than actually listening to them, which can lead to ineffective, uninformed methods that can lose you time, money and customers.

So how do you effectively listen to your customer base? This blog aims to guide you through some ideas that can help you find the best strategy for you and your firm.

Yes, this is a very direct way of doing it, but surveys are a great way for your audience to tell you just what they want from you. Ensure the survey helps you determine what you audience are looking for, what their challenges are and what they look for in companies that do what you do. These are great for both existing customers and prospective clients as it will allow you to improve your services in line with their expectations and help your retention rates.

<strong>Take a Look at your Analytics</strong>

Looking through your web traffic and social media data can give you an insight into who your audience is, what they’re looking for and help you increase conversions.

Use this data to see where engagement is strongest, where it drops and use this information to direct all of your marketing activities.

<strong>Read the Room</strong>

Social listening is a great marketing tool that allows businesses to see how they rank against their competitors and the general mood towards their company.

People use social media to vent or praise companies and it’s vital that you know what people think of your business whether positive or negative. This allows you to correct your course and adapt your marketing strategies from there.

It’s important to keep up to date with how audiences react and make them feel heard."
"Each website is different, and each business has different goals they’re looking to achieve. It will take a bit of tweaking and general maintenance to have a site that is consistently bringing great results. However, this blog aims to point out a few of the issues that are regularly found in website audits.

Whether you’re creating a new site or you’re looking to work on your current situation where maintenance has perhaps taken a backseat to getting fresh content out there, these issues can affect your site in multiple ways. Some mistakes can cause havoc to your SEO and some will make your site slower therefore more difficult to navigate. Either issue means that you’ll have fewer sales and lost customers. It’s recommended a site audit is performed every six months so that you can identify and rectify any issues.

Ensure you are using your keywords effectively. Don’t overstuff them into very short pieces of content as they should make up around 2% of your content. Make sure you use them in your title tags and alt-tags on images.

It’s important that your site is easy to navigate, and your customers can find what they need in as few clicks as possible. Remove deep pages and broken links in order to improve the user experience. 88% of users report they would be unlikely to return to a site if they had a poor experience on a website. That’s a lot of potential customers lost!

Make sure your site is up to speed by enabling compression for your java and CSS files hosted on external sites. You should also remove unnecessary lines, white-space and comments from your source code to fix unminify JavaScript and CSS.

These tips aren’t a complete fix to your website issues and it’s important to maintain every aspect of your site to ensure you’re reaching as many people as possible. However, this blog should help you solve obvious issues that are having a negative impact on your SEO and the experience of your customers."
"We're all feeling the effects of Covid-19 and concerned for what the future holds, particularly small business owners.

On the brighter side of things, online marketing is still an effective tool for your business - maybe now more than ever.

Have you shut up shop? Closed the doors to self-isolate? Committed to the hermit life?

There's no need to distance yourself from the online world, more people are logged on and scrolling than ever right now and it's as good an opportunity as any to spread the word about your business, put out some positivity and most importantly - connect and engage with your audience.

Don't lockdown and allow people to forget about you, not only will you lose momentum with all that fabulous content you're posting, but you'll likely lose followers too.

Your customer base is still there and very much listening, so keep on popping up in people's newsfeeds and connecting with your followers - even if you aren’t open for business right now (but hiding under a duvet with the dog and your laptop), make yourself known! Whether it’s recycling old content, posting a good ol' throwback or spreading some love - it’s a great time for connecting and engaging.

Stay safe, stay visible online - whatever your business!"
"<strong>70-80% of searchers focus on Organic search results(SEO) over paid Ad results - .</strong>

More traffic means more sales. Optimising the individual product pages on your ecommerce site is one of the most effective ways to improve the traffic to your site. This blog aims to give you tips and tricks to help your business succeed.

The name of a product is the biggest influence on organic search rankings. The product name is typically in the title, heading tags and other related metadata. Highly descriptive product names are clear for both consumers and the search engine algorithms. Product names are usually set in stone, but modifying the information in the title is a great way to differentiate between similar products so customers can find exactly what they’re looking for.

<strong>Don’t just cut and paste the product names used on Amazon or your competitors – add a little extra thought.</strong>

Add extensive product descriptions. You can list options including colour, size, material, style along with any other attributes or features that may improve contextual search relevance and help shoppers. Shoppers will have landed directly from a search engine, which means they may be unfamiliar with your site. Make sure you make everything easy to use so they don’t bounce back to search results. Use highlights and bullet points.

<strong>Each product page is its own advert so treat it like it was going to appear on a road side billboard – now will your customers still like what they see?</strong>

User generated content is an SEO goldmine, underutilised by many ecommerce websites. User generated content such as reviews can boost contextual relevance by using the language of the reviews to change and alter the language in your description, which can boost SEO rankings. Implemented correctly, these reviews can be considered part of the site’s content. However, if done wrong or these reviews are filled with spam, it can muddle the relevancy and even have a negative impact on your site’s ranking. In order to avoid this, it is vital reviews are moderated and maybe even pin the most helpful comments to the top of the list. There are so many partner review sites out there, <a href="http://www.trustpilot.com">www.trustpliot.com</a>. <a href="http://www.reviews.co.uk">www.reviews.co.uk</a> or just add a genuine one yourself.

Using the usual SEO tips and tricks are great, but ecommerce sites have a lot of options that many don’t even think to take advantage of. Take your business to the next level by improving your SEO ranking and making it easier for consumers to find you. Your e-commerce package will have a section on SEO best practises that are optimised for the way it works. Please take time to read and understand what they recommend and do it! These are big companies with big research budgets, they earn more when you earn more ie when you get more traffic."
"With almost 43 million Brits using social media regularly, businesses are missing out on a huge potential advertising platform by not utilising these free platforms.

It’s an ideal way to connect with people who already love your brand and introduce it to those yet to discover it. This blog aims to give you social media tips that can help you build your brand, reach new markets and, ultimately, increase revenue.

Posting is easy but it’s wise to start with a plan. Figure out exactly what you’re looking to achieve and ensure your social media posts and efforts support you in meeting your goals. Ensure you follow smart guidelines; posts should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. It’s also important to make sure your aims are actually right for your business. Focus on increasing sales rather than likes (though giving your followers list a boost will help in making your business look legit). Observe what your competitors are doing and learn from their successes and their mistakes. You want to keep your presence unique but it’s just smart to see what’s working and what isn’t and reduce your own learning curve. In addition to looking at your competitors, take inspiration from businesses and industries different from yours.

If you’re already using social media, time to evaluate its effectiveness. Perform an audit and take a good look at your analytics to see if you’re reaching the audience you’re looking to. It also helps to have a social media calendar in place so you can keep track of when to post and check your platform stats and insights for optimal time to post and engage.

Establish who you’re looking to reach with your posts. Finding your target audience is vital for any business and doing so allows you to determine which platform is right for your business. That doesn’t mean you need to limit yourself to one. This allows you to know how to distribute your social media resources most effectively. Once you know how your audience responds, it will be easier to expand your audience.

Responding and reacting to relevant comments is a great way to use social media as a business. Whether that’s responding to criticism or praise, letting your customers know you care and are listening to their concerns is an effective way to build trust and guide the narrative around your business.

You can also schedule your posts to free up your time for engagement, there is various online software out there to help with this such as Hootsuite. Once you’ve established what posts do well on which platform and at what time, you can spend a small amount of time creating all of your social media posts and using scheduling tools and programs to post them automatically at the right time."

<p>Do you ever wonder why you follow, engage and click through on a&nbsp;brand or your favourite shop’s&nbsp;social media&nbsp;profile? Social media is&nbsp;powerful;&nbsp;it’s a direct line to an audience who crave updates,&nbsp;information and, well… YOU!&nbsp;It’s a must for anyone looking to market themselves to a wider audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So you might be thinking that&nbsp;writing is not really your forte?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fear not!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so many options for writing on social media - Facebook posts, tweets, Instagram captions full of hashtags or even the LinkedIn space for blog articles - it's just a matter of understanding what is best-suited to promoting your business and&nbsp;becoming a master&nbsp;on that platform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this&nbsp;section,&nbsp;we will give you some tips to start writing better content for your social&nbsp;networks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with the basic rule of writing on the web:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Write the way you speak&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine sitting with friends having a drink talking about your business. That tone, that type of language and that level of simplicity should be your goal in promoting your company on the web. This way your content will be more natural, more authentic and easier to read.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is especially true of&nbsp;social media,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a more informal medium than other&nbsp;channels.&nbsp;Your content should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn more about you or your business. So avoid technicalities,&nbsp;being too articulate – Think, light.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Update your content frequently</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do it often. Write as much as possible. This has two advantages:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. You&nbsp;will improve&nbsp;your&nbsp;writing:&nbsp;practice will help you hone your skills and find your voice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;You will keep the attention of your readers -&nbsp;publish on Facebook and&nbsp;Instagram once&nbsp;a day. This&nbsp;will get you in the rhythm and help you practice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all social media posts will be stunning content, but that's okay. See it this way: every post that is not very successful will be a lesson on what not to do&nbsp;– Practice makes perfect, remember?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Add visual elements to your posts</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to keep readers' attention on your content, add photos - but also graphs, tables, videos, GIFs and more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;most popular are&nbsp;videos,&nbsp;especially on Facebook and Instagram. Opt for video in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vertical format to encourage usability on smartphones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same thing goes for your blog content. Not only will readers appreciate that you don't have to scroll through a wall of words, but you will have an additional tool for doing SEO, as search engines scan images and captions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>S</strong><strong>hort posts for engagement, l</strong><strong>ong content for traffic</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about link building for your blog: one of the main reasons why people use social media is to drive traffic to their pages. What kind of content are you writing for your blog? Are they long, short or somewhere in-between?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no precise rules&nbsp;on how long your posts should be. In truth, they should first of all be well&nbsp;written.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, short posts are best for gathering feedback, comments and other types of interactions from readers (people prefer to read short texts, so you are more likely to have their attention if you write less than 300 words). Longer posts (1,000-2,500 words), full of keywords and information, are better for stimulating social sharing and search engine&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, go forth and&nbsp;try your hand at a few social media post – you’ll see it’s a lot easier than you think.&nbsp;</p>

Whatever your industry or however you trade, your site will always be one of the most important aspects of your business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Is your website proudly flying the flag for your business? Is your site mobile friendly? Does it take more than 3 seconds to load? These are all questions you should take into consideration when it comes to online marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A user-friendly, clear and informative website goes hand in hand with your digital marketing strategy, so it’s crucial for your website to tick all the boxes or it could very well waste the time and money you’re putting into your SEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The loading time of your website is incredibly important to any online business&nbsp;and&nbsp;can make or break your web traffic, and vastly change the level of sales your business converts. We live in an age of instant-gratification, and customers are increasingly impatient. A slow loading webpage can be all it takes for a potential customer to click away, losing you a business opportunity. Monitoring and bettering your website load times should be a key part of your website development, as it has the potential to make or break your online marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;Google search algorithm is constantly evolving and improving. It is designed to promote websites&nbsp;that prioritise user-experience, due to which it prioritises what it deems the ‘highest-quality’ websites in its result ranking. The factors the algorithm uses to determine what constitutes a ‘high quality’ webpage changes over time, and one of the latest editions relates to website load times. In 2020,&nbsp;Google added the ‘core website vitals’ factor, something which is in part determined by the time it takes a website to load. It is generally believed that 3 seconds or less is the ideal website load time to maintain customer interest. The problem with this? The majority of websites take far longer than this to load, especially on mobile, which consistently takes longer than desktop due to a lower processing capability.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effect of load time on your business website may come as a surprise, indeed it is something you may have never thought to consider before. If your website is hosted by a low-quality website hosting provider, it may also be one of the key problems your online marketing is facing. The first step to creating a faster website load time is in finding out what your current load time is. There are a variety of tools available online to check your website load time. You should carry this test out on both mobile and desktop, in order to access how well your webpage loading is performing on both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a different mobile and desktop site layout can be a simple way to speed up slow mobile website load times, especially important when so many customers will be accessing your business webpage from their phone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you identify that your website has a slow loading time, it is best to work with a web developer to get it down to that ideal 3 seconds or less. They will be able to work with you to redesign your website in a way that prioritises load time. This can be achieved through a number of tactics, like reducing redirects, changing image size, utilising effective website links, and prioritising the loading speed of your most high-performing webpages, and the webpages you expect your customer to click on most frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the simplest ways to create a better webpage load speed is to change to a higher quality website hosting platform. Through improving your webpage loading speed, you make your business far more accessible to your&nbsp;customers and&nbsp;help to increase your online engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Online marketing can be incredibly rewarding, but also incredibly frustrating at times. After months of tweaking your webpages, working on key words, and prioritising search engine optimisation, you finally watch your webpage climb the ranks. It is like trying to climb a mountain, and after months of perseverance, and planning, you have done it. You have achieved online marketing success, and your business is reaping the rewards. Then suddenly, you notice you are falling down again, and your website has lost that all important&nbsp;page&nbsp;ranking spot you worked so hard to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest problem here is the way in which we think about the rankings.&nbsp;Google rankings are not a static thing, a task you work hard at and achieve. The main reason that your business website has fallen down the&nbsp;Google search rankings is because the internet is not a static place. It can feel like a real landscape, as sure and difficult to traverse as any mountain range, but it is ultimately an evolving series of code. Your website needs to be able to evolve and adapt, as does your social media marketing strategy, in order to keep up with an evolving platform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all remember the old days of dial-up internet, with its clunky user interfaces, and long wait times. This old internet seems a world away from the sleek and speedy search engines of today. The truth is that even today, the internet is growing and changing, and will be entirely different in the years to come. Every modern business wants and needs a successful online presence, and it can be disheartening to see your website drop down&nbsp;the Google rankings. Unfortunately, something as simple as a tweaking of the&nbsp;Google algorithm, or a development in technology can cause&nbsp;many&nbsp;issues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, more and more businesses are becoming aware of the power of online marketing and trying to use it effectively as part of their business strategy. This means that more and more websites are popping up every day, and your business website could move down the&nbsp;Google rankings today due to a website that just didn’t exist yesterday. It is important not to get complacent when it comes to your online marketing. Search engine optimisation is an active, ongoing process, that needs to change with the changing landscape of computer-mediated communication. The more internet savvy we get, the more effort needs to go into an effective online marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important factor is one that has always existed. Businesses have always had to traverse the changing times, even before the invention of the internet. The wants and needs of your customers are always changing and updating, and businesses need to change with it. You can fall down the&nbsp;Google rankings simply because what people were searching for yesterday just isn’t what they are looking for today. A successful business must keep up to date with the changing times, understanding and meeting the evolving needs of their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Increasing organic website traffic is not an easy thing to accomplish but it’s is not impossible - by investing a bit of time and commitment, and a few successful strategies, you’ll generate more traffic in no time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at 3 ways we can do this and understand why it’s important to work hard on these aspects and improve them:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Gain valuable links to your content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Use internal links – Internal links help Google understand the context and relationships between the different articles on your website. It then uses this information as classification signals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have accumulated a decent amount of content for SEO, you can cite it on your blog and your website, guiding visitors to more relevant content marketing. This can keep visitors on your website longer, which helps improve search engine rankings. However, don't abuse internal links - using too many of them could make your content look like spam.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend that you make a habit of linking to your older articles in your new articles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Search for keywords - SEO tools are essential for identifying various parameters related to your site. Backlinks, competitors, keywords etc. They can be collected by these tools and this information is useful for classifying your website and, ultimately, for positioning the site on Google.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Find Influencers - There are several ways to find influencers in your sector. Google gives you access to a large online database. Plus, you can find the right influencer for your niche on Youtube, an ideal platform for influencer marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another tool you can use to search for influencers is a link analysis tool. By checking the *backlinks of your competitors, you can understand where the traffic is coming from and find influencers in your sector.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*A backlink is an inbound link to your content from an external website. Backlinks are one of the most influential signals in Google rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep your content fresh&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is your website full of old content that has stopped attracting visitors? If so, you may be able to revitalise this content by updating it for the current year!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is constantly evolving and if your site only has old content, you won't attract results. The following changes can boost a page's search ranking quickly:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Update of the year in the page title, for example, change from “hottest trends of 2019” to “hottest trends of 2020”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Correction of any broken links in the content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Updating outdated screenshots&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Using statistics for the current year&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Correction of broken images&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Make sure your content stays up to date. It doesn't take long and can make a big difference to your site!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Indexed Pages&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common mistake is to confuse "indexing" with "ranking".&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The are two related but completely different things!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By indexing on search engines, we mean “making a website or blog visible among the results that a search engine returns (regardless of position)”.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By positioning, on the other hand, we mean " all those techniques aimed at making a website in the best possible position among the results for certain keywords ".&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indexing is the basis (without that you can't rank anything), ranking comes next and is about the ability to get your site or page up among the top positions on Google or other search engines. Pages must be indexed on Google correctly, using the Google Webmaster Tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These days, anyone can create a website, but only a few can boast a truly effective website. What does an&nbsp;<em>“effective website"</em>&nbsp;mean and what are the characteristics that distinguish it from an&nbsp;<em>"ineffective"</em>&nbsp;one?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we will try to provide you with some simple, but useful information which you can use to benchmark whether your site is effective and if it is not, how to address certain issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Go for clean graphics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simplicity, minimalism, linearity are the key concepts that dominate web design trends. Many sites tend to favour content over images, but the importance of using quality photos should be emphasised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colours and photos must be well balanced, clear and incisive. The use of poor-quality graphics and content will cause users to never return to your website. It is therefore, absolutely necessary to show high quality images to influence a potential customer's purchase decision and improve the overall quality of your ecommerce site.</p>

<p>When the user doesn't know what to expect after clicking on a link or doesn't know where to click to find the information they are looking for, it will cause in them to leave your site. So, make sure you create a website that is easy for users to navigate and understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of clear and intuitive categories and labels serves to communicate what your business is dedicated to. From the first moment, users will know they are in the right place and how to find the information they are looking for. Pay particular attention to the phrases and language you use to communicate with users, in order to facilitate their search.</p>

<h2><strong>Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your goal, when you decide to create an effective website, is to translate your&nbsp;<em>potential</em>&nbsp;leads into customers, and to sell, you need to attract a lot of people to your site.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This won’t be possible if you do not carry out good SEO practice, allowing you to improve visibility of the website rankings on search engines. The higher you are positioned within these engines, the greater your chances of getting noticed in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Write useful content for your users</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Website content writing</strong>&nbsp;must be of quality, original and relevant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is nothing worse than boring, uninteresting, soulless&nbsp;<strong>web content</strong>, so, avoid copying and pasting from the corporate brochure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always ask yourself what your users want and think about what they might find interesting. Answering their questions with relevant and clear answers is your goal. If your responses are appreciated, people will be happy to share your content on their social channels.</p>

<h2>Presence on Social Networks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another essential factor to increase the effectiveness of your site is to increase your presence on&nbsp;<strong>social media platforms&nbsp;</strong>like, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creation of a page will allow people to trace your website even more, sharing information and content too and will connect directly to your site, allowing greater visibility.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you want to get more involved, you can create real sponsored campaigns to gain visibility, engagement or visits. One of the social networks that allows you to do this Facebook Ads.</p>

<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CTA marketing</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most important points: whether it is the "buy", "subscribe" or "contact us" button, it must be positioned wisely, because it is the&nbsp;<strong>call to action on a website&nbsp;</strong>that actually converts a visitor into a lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A CTA allows the user to enter an area that you have designated for them; a landing page, an information page or a page to fill in the data for a contact request.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From your point of view, calls to action are really important, because they allow you to guide the visitor in the direction you want and to offer content made especially for them. The CTA must also stand out visually and stand out from the rest of the page, perhaps with a different colour or a particular font.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We hope that these tips will provide you with a starting point towards tackling the design and effectiveness of your website and guiding you towards a more modern, more successful and professional online business.</strong></p>

<p>Instagram is a fundamental resource for reaching and creating relationships with your audience. However, there are some rules to follow to make the most of this social network and obtain tangible benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Need a strategy to get your Instagram profile off the ground, or want to know how to increase Instagram followers? Follow these Instagram marketing tips steps and you’ll be on the right path!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Determine Who Your Audience is&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with the basics. First of all, the first two questions you need to ask yourself are:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>·</strong> Who are you trying to reach with your Instagram profile?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Are you sure your audience is using the app?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's smart to plan your Instagram campaigns with a clearly defined audience in mind&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researching your demographic is essential before you start posting Instagram content. Define the age, gender, interests of your ideal audience so you can properly cater to the content.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Define Your Goals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are your goals? What do you want to do with your Instagram profile?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you create an Instagram marketing strategy, it's essential to always have in mind what goals you want to achieve. I recommend that you make a proper list of the goals you intend to achieve. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Collaborate with companies</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Increase followers&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Sell your followers</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Engage with Instagram users&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Create a Content Strategy&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Potentially the most decisive part of your marketing strategy is deciding what to post to enhance and improve your Instagram profile and achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you need to understand which of the following content formats is best suited to your users:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Photo&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Video&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>·</strong> User-Generated Content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Stories&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the while making sure your Instagram feed has the quality and aesthetically pleasing photos and videos!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Understanding what to post on Instagram and choosing the right content and format will help increase Instagram engagement and appear on your followers feed, allowing you to get more likes and views.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Create a Content Calendar</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid posting at the last minute in a hurry I suggest you make a calendar that will allow you to organise and plan your feed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being consistent and systematic is more important than how often to post on Instagram. Instagram's algorithm favours an account that posts twice a day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best tactic for choosing how regularly to post is to observe when your followers are most active throughout the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. Plan and Schedule the Captions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important factor influencing your strategy is the need to have good Instagram captions! This is where you talk to your audience and get the chance to talk about yourself or your brand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to always use language that is in line with your audience, use language that is easy to understand, don’t opt for big words or complex and long-winded phrases or sentences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hashtags are just as important for Instagram and must be placed directly in your caption or the first comment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the process of analysing your target audience and competitors, you will have an idea of the most used hashtags in your industry, but it is always worth doing further research.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Monitor Progress&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the last step. Use Instagram Insights to get a basic idea of what's effective or not with your audience. You will understand if your Instagram organic growth strategy is doing well or not. If it's not going the way you thought, try to understand why and fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we explained a few steps to building an effective organic growth strategy on Instagram. Take your time and experiment – you’ll soon find what works and what doesn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2021 is in its infancy still, but 2020 has given us an important lesson to all those who did not believe that the internet could get bigger and busier in such a short space of time: the future of sales is firmly online and those who cannot seize the opportunities that digital has to offer, will soon find themselves totally cut off from the market.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The situation generated by the Covid-19 pandemic has forced people to spend much more time at home and therefore today more than ever consumers are looking for information online instead of physically going to the store, and more and more often, they will purchase directly online.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What should companies expect to implement in their strategies for 2021?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below we’ll share with you a few tips and ideas that should feature in your digital marketing plan, and remain firmly in place going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Commerce&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even those who have never heard of it before will be able to easily guess what we mean when we talk about “<strong>social commerce</strong>”: it is the sale of products made directly through social networks, often taking advantage of posts or comments.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vast majority of online shopping usually happens like this:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· the potential buyer researches the product that interests him/her&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· looks for useful information on the product and the brand (also through social networks)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· when he/she decides to make the purchase, the sale takes place on the brand's <strong>e-commerce site&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why not simplify this long process by moving sales directly to social media? <strong>With social commerce</strong>, the entire purchasing process, including the sale of the product, takes place directly on social networks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Media Marketing&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social media marketing</strong> often appears as something boring and ineffective, but the reality is it requires you to be present with a certain continuity on the social networks where your ideal target customer is present and active.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook has become a powerful tool for even small businesses and can <strong>increase web traffic</strong> and profits when used effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook uses very sophisticated audience targeting features that can filter your audience based on a variety of factors, including age, gender, social location, previous purchase activity or expression of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By using these targeting techniques, Facebook ads increase the likelihood that your ad will be relevant to the people you want to see it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook also helps determine the goal of your ads and you can then choose the type of focus you want for your ads. You can also choose ad placement based on the experience you want your potential buyer to have.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Search Engine Optimisation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once your 2021 strategy and marketing plan has been defined, in addition to <strong>email marketing</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong> is always the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Search engine optimisation</strong> is the process of "formatting" your web content to make it more easily intercepted by search engines. This increases the likelihood of your content appearing when your target prospect searches for topics, answers, information, products, services, and small businesses like yours.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is extremely important for small businesses because being able to <strong>optimise your web content</strong> to bring them to the top of the <strong>search engine rankings </strong>always means having a possible competitive advantage over your competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, aim to properly set up your <strong>Google My Business</strong> profile. Make sure you complete all fields, including bio, product and service descriptions, opening hours, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also share the review link on Google and encourage your satisfied customers to leave their feedback. Their feedback affects your credibility, and Google will also reward you by improving your position in its rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Voice Search in 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second trend to take into consideration during this new year is that linked to <strong>voice search</strong>: more and more often potential customers use their <strong>voice to search</strong> on the internet; complicit in this new trend is the increasingly widespread diffusion of virtual assistants&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(such as Alexa, Siri, Bixby and Google Assistant).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The content we offer on the web must be optimised for this type of search, for example by exploiting the <strong>long-tail keywords</strong>. The SEO specialist of our company will have to take into account the fact that, when users use voice research, they resort to longer and more complex sentences, ask questions, in short, they use a more natural and spoken language.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure success, a company must keep customer touchpoints under their control. Make sure these basic tips are part of your 2021 marketing plan so your brand will experience a new period of engagement and profitability.&nbsp;</p>

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>
Professional advisers some acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</ul>
<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<strong>Services</strong>

<strong>Bespoke Website Service
Website Design and Development</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Design is subjective, and for this reason we offer ‘unlimited design revisions’. This means that we will continue to work with you on your design concept until you are happy with our proposal. The unlimited design revision period ends when the client accepts the design proposal and home page draft. Design changes beyond this point are subject to additional charges.</li>

 	<li>Development of the client’s project will meet the requirements as set out in the specification provided in the initial invoice supplied to the client as part of the confirmation order email. It is important that the client is aware of the specification that has been agreed to as additional functional requirements that are requested may be liable to additional charges.</li>
 	<li>If client requests on a development project are in excess of the specification agreed Elevate Online marketing LTD will inform the client and offer a cost to meet the new specification.</li>
 	<li>Elevate Online Marketing LTD will provide the client with an expected completion time frame for the project (live on the internet) if requested. Elevate Online Marketing LTD will also provide a client access to its ‘Project Cycle’ documentation to ensure a client is fully aware of the responsibilities they have to ensure a successful and timely development.</li>
 	<li>Open-Source software (OSS) is publicly available software that may be adapted or modified to suit particular applications. OSS may be used to help develop elements of the functionality of the client’s website to speed development and add functionality. Where Open-Source software is used, the ownership of the site coding and any customisations made by the developer is still passed to the client upon final payment.</li>
 	<li>Elevate Online Marketing Ltd. do not take any responsibility for a client’s website rank on search engines unless a separate marketing package has been purchased. When updating, changing, creating and hosting a client’s website, there could be a change in the websites search engine ranking.</li>

</ol>
<strong>Website Text Copy (Content) &amp; Products</strong>
<ol>

If the client doesn’t require this service, Elevate Online Marketing Ltd. will require the client to send all content that is to be added to the website in a Microsoft Word doc file. This excludes products on an ecommerce site as these are to be added by the client once the site is complete.

<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
Excluding business partners, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h3>Business Partners:</h3>
ElevateOM may share personal information with business partners. When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
 	<li>If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<p>2021 is in its infancy still, but 2020 has given us an important lesson to all those who did not believe that the internet could get bigger and busier in such a short space of time: the future of sales is firmly online and those who cannot seize the opportunities that digital has to offer, will soon find themselves totally cut off from the market.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The situation generated by the Covid-19 pandemic has forced people to spend much more time at home and therefore today more than ever consumers are looking for information online instead of physically going to the store, and more and more often, they will purchase directly online.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What should companies expect to implement in their strategies for 2021?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below we’ll share with you a few tips and ideas that should feature in your digital marketing plan, and remain firmly in place going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Commerce&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even those who have never heard of it before will be able to easily guess what we mean when we talk about “<strong>social commerce</strong>”: it is the sale of products made directly through social networks, often taking advantage of posts or comments.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vast majority of online shopping usually happens like this:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· the potential buyer researches the product that interests him/her&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· looks for useful information on the product and the brand (also through social networks)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· when he/she decides to make the purchase, the sale takes place on the brand's <strong>e-commerce site&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why not simplify this long process by moving sales directly to social media? <strong>With social commerce</strong>, the entire purchasing process, including the sale of the product, takes place directly on social networks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Media Marketing&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social media marketing</strong> often appears as something boring and ineffective, but the reality is it requires you to be present with a certain continuity on the social networks where your ideal target customer is present and active.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook has become a powerful tool for even small businesses and can <strong>increase web traffic</strong> and profits when used effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook uses very sophisticated audience targeting features that can filter your audience based on a variety of factors, including age, gender, social location, previous purchase activity or expression of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By using these targeting techniques, Facebook ads increase the likelihood that your ad will be relevant to the people you want to see it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook also helps determine the goal of your ads and you can then choose the type of focus you want for your ads. You can also choose ad placement based on the experience you want your potential buyer to have.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Search Engine Optimisation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once your 2021 strategy and marketing plan has been defined, in addition to <strong>email marketing</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong> is always the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Search engine optimisation</strong> is the process of "formatting" your web content to make it more easily intercepted by search engines. This increases the likelihood of your content appearing when your target prospect searches for topics, answers, information, products, services, and small businesses like yours.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is extremely important for small businesses because being able to <strong>optimise your web content</strong> to bring them to the top of the <strong>search engine rankings </strong>always means having a possible competitive advantage over your competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, aim to properly set up your <strong>Google My Business</strong> profile. Make sure you complete all fields, including bio, product and service descriptions, opening hours, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also share the review link on Google and encourage your satisfied customers to leave their feedback. Their feedback affects your credibility, and Google will also reward you by improving your position in its rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Voice Search in 2021&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second trend to take into consideration during this new year is that linked to <strong>voice search</strong>: more and more often potential customers use their <strong>voice to search</strong> on the internet; complicit in this new trend is the increasingly widespread diffusion of virtual assistants&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(such as Alexa, Siri, Bixby and Google Assistant).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The content we offer on the web must be optimised for this type of search, for example by exploiting the <strong>long-tail keywords</strong>. The SEO specialist of our company will have to take into account the fact that, when users use voice research, they resort to longer and more complex sentences, ask questions, in short, they use a more natural and spoken language.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure success, a company must keep customer touchpoints under their control. Make sure these basic tips are part of your 2021 marketing plan so your brand will experience a new period of engagement and profitability.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Building responsive websites that work across different devices is essential to ensure a good user experience. A study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Price Waterhouse Coopers showed that mobile ad spend in the UK overtook desktop for the first time –therefore, having a mobile-friendly website is key to tapping into this growing trend.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What does a mobile-friendly website mean </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meaning of mobile-friendly refers to a website with a clear and light structure, which uses a web design capable of making navigation fluid and usable even via mobile devices. The pages of a site of this type load quickly and are readable in their entirety, without the need to zoom or scroll horizontally to continue reading.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>But, why make a website mobile friendly? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. There are more users. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first reason why it is necessary to make your website to be mobile friendly is, essentially, a numerical fact: users who access the Internet from mobile have overtaken those who do it only from a desktop. The latest figures show that in the UK, mobile and tablets accounted for 52.4% of the market share when browsing (source).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobile-optimised websites can use unique features that make it easier for users to engage and provide them with the information they're looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Google penalises non-mobile Friendly sites </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google has already made it known for some time that it has updated its search algorithms to favour Mobile Friendly websites and Google considers a long list of items when deciding how optimised a website is for mobile devices, such as:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· The scalability of fonts for readability on small screens&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· The spacing and usability of the tactile elements&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. User experience is maximised </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking text and other page elements designed for a computer screen and compressing them to fit mobile phones is far from the best way to optimise the user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mobile responsive design should be focused on making it as easy as possible for users to navigate and find the information they need. A responsive design can reduce elements to fit the screen, but this is only the first step in creating a good mobile user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, 44% of consumers say their mobile device is their most important aid in making purchasing decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Effects on brand image </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brand that does not have a mobile-friendly website, in addition to being penalised by Google, gives itself a careless online image because it is not in line with the latest technological developments. The consequence of this is in the next point...&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Favours competition </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A customer who needs a product or service at a precise moment will favour a mobile responsive website over a desktop-only site due to the nature of how we like to buy things these days; he/she will be pushed to engage a competing brand that offers the same product/service but that has of a mobile-friendly website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developing a unique, mobile-friendly website is simply the only way to maximise user experience which, ultimately, can lead to important results for your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optimisation can make the difference between e-commerce businesses that thrive and those that don't. Enhancing a product page for search engines is especially important if you want your products to be noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are 8 tips to make sure your product pages are properly optimised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Put your keywords in the title </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most important elements is that of the page title tag. If you type a keyword into Google, you will notice that most of the results will have the keyword in the title tag. To have the best possible title, make sure you do your research on the best search keyword to use for the product/s, perhaps with the help of the AdWords Keyword Tool.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Use the Meta Tag Description</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is a meta tag description? A meta description tag is a snippet used to summarise a web page's content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do a Google search for any keyword, you will notice the search results typically displaying descriptions that have the keyword. For the best SEO results, you need to use the product keywords in the description.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An important aspect of this tag is to make sure that you have a unique description tag for each product page. Do not duplicate these tags.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Use the Meta Alt Tag in product images </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is alt tag? They are used within an HTML code to describe the appearance and function of an image on a page.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The alt tag for the image tells search engines what it really is. Use this alt tag as an opportunity to insert a keyword to optimise the specific product page.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enter keywords in the URLs </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A key element for search engine optimisation is the real URL, that is, www.domainname.com/keyword. You need to enter the most important keywords in the product page URLs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why are keywords important? Basically, it can help users understand what a page is about.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are doing a Google search for a keyword for a product, look at the URL of a page in the search results. It will likely find the keyword/s that is most relevant within the URL string.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Robust product descriptions </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As much as it’s true that content is king for SEO, many e-commerce sites don't use proper descriptions of their products, such as what it is, how it works, and the main points consumers need to know. Importantly, don't write product descriptions just for the search engine. Write the descriptions to give "help" to consumers. Use keywords if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create your link to the product page </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building content and links are very important for SEO. It is therefore important that product pages have links pointing to them. They not only help that specific page but your whole website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a lot of websites or bloggers who point to other sites. For example, if the site sells football jerseys, you can link to football bloggers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Display social network buttons </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media activity positively affects search engines. Make sure you have share buttons on each product page to allow users to share and distribute the product. Pinterest, for example, allows users to post a photo while linking to that image's source. Make sure each product page has social media sharing buttons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Use reviews </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to help the product page work in search engines is to use user-created content, such as SEO product reviews. The best example of effective reviews is Amazon.com, which uses them not only to help consumers but also for SEO purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, following SEO best practices to optimise your product pages will ensure more potential clients access your particular product pages and have the confidence to click through to a sale.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instagram is a fundamental resource for reaching and creating relationships with your audience. However, there are some rules to follow to make the most of this social network and obtain tangible benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Need a strategy to get your Instagram profile off the ground, or want to know how to increase Instagram followers? Follow these Instagram marketing tips steps and you’ll be on the right path!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Determine Who Your Audience is&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with the basics. First of all, the first two questions you need to ask yourself are:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>·</strong> Who are you trying to reach with your Instagram profile?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Are you sure your audience is using the app?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's smart to plan your Instagram campaigns with a clearly defined audience in mind&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researching your demographic is essential before you start posting Instagram content. Define the age, gender, interests of your ideal audience so you can properly cater to the content.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Define Your Goals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are your goals? What do you want to do with your Instagram profile?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you create an Instagram marketing strategy, it's essential to always have in mind what goals you want to achieve. I recommend that you make a proper list of the goals you intend to achieve. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Collaborate with companies</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Increase followers&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Sell your followers</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Engage with Instagram users&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Create a Content Strategy&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Potentially the most decisive part of your marketing strategy is deciding what to post to enhance and improve your Instagram profile and achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you need to understand which of the following content formats is best suited to your users:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Photo&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Video&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>·</strong> User-Generated Content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Stories&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the while making sure your Instagram feed has the quality and aesthetically pleasing photos and videos!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Understanding what to post on Instagram and choosing the right content and format will help increase Instagram engagement and appear on your followers feed, allowing you to get more likes and views.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Create a Content Calendar</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid posting at the last minute in a hurry I suggest you make a calendar that will allow you to organise and plan your feed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being consistent and systematic is more important than how often to post on Instagram. Instagram's algorithm favours an account that posts twice a day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best tactic for choosing how regularly to post is to observe when your followers are most active throughout the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. Plan and Schedule the Captions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important factor influencing your strategy is the need to have good Instagram captions! This is where you talk to your audience and get the chance to talk about yourself or your brand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to always use language that is in line with your audience, use language that is easy to understand, don’t opt for big words or complex and long-winded phrases or sentences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hashtags are just as important for Instagram and must be placed directly in your caption or the first comment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the process of analysing your target audience and competitors, you will have an idea of the most used hashtags in your industry, but it is always worth doing further research.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Monitor Progress&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the last step. Use Instagram Insights to get a basic idea of what's effective or not with your audience. You will understand if your Instagram organic growth strategy is doing well or not. If it's not going the way you thought, try to understand why and fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we explained a few steps to building an effective organic growth strategy on Instagram. Take your time and experiment – you’ll soon find what works and what doesn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyone who has a business and wants to improve google rankings in local search results on Google must have a clear understanding of the concept of Local SEO and the most effective strategies to optimise its effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is local SEO?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local SEO refers to the process of optimising a business’s website for local search results on a search engine i.e. Google, Bing, Yahoo</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local search results are based on three factors: relevance, distance, and evidence, which appear in various places on Maps and Search, and are shown to users who want to find businesses and places of interest near their own locality. A local search query generally includes information such as the name of the city, the neighbourhood, or the street, for example: “Restaurant London Camden”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How to optimise SEO for local search</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Refine your Business listings</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bing Places for Business or Google My Business is a service that brings together Maps, Business Pages and local social information. It is designed to help businesses take control of what people see when they do a local business search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specifically, the service allows you to verify and modify your information to attract users / potential customers and allows you to interact more easily with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is very important to pay attention to the optimisation of your Google My Business profile and to provide Google with as much information as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Create an accurate description of your business</li><li>Choose the correct category of your business</li><li>Upload some nice photos in the right resolution</li><li>Enter the opening/closing times&nbsp;</li><li>Enter the correct address</li><li>Enter the phone number and the various contacts</li><li>Request/get reviews from your customers</li><li>Update your profile often</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these aspects could make a difference!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Optimise your site for mobile devices.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to improve Local SEO, you must be optimised for mobile devices. A user looking for a service and product wants to find the information right away. For example, if you own a restaurant, make your phone number, address and opening and closing times immediately visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobile usability is, in fact, a fundamental aspect of local searches. Among the most common mistakes to avoid are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>excessive slow loading of the web page;</li><li>use of incompatible plug-ins;</li><li>content that is too large for the screen;</li><li>text too small to read;</li><li>selectable elements too close together.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create local SEO content&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content is the basis of good Local SEO optimisation. Make the most of<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://elevateom.com/get-the-most-out-of-your-seo/"><span class="has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color">SEO copywriting</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and create the content of interest, enhancing the strengths of your business. Optimise business pages and create interesting landing pages that contain certain keywords that you consider fundamental for your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only that, get the most out of your blog and write news updates or a weekly post related to your city, such as events and things to do nearby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Local Link building and business directories</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A well-structured local link building campaign will bring advantages in terms of organic search positioning. It is therefore important to earn links through quality content and to find authoritative sites and directories where you can place your business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some examples of valuable local directories:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>BingPlaces</li><li>Yelp</li><li>Yell</li><li>Foursquare City Guide</li><li>Free Index</li><li>Hot Frog</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this short guide to Local SEO, you have read how to best optimise a website for local organic search positioning that allows users find your business easily. Implementing a few of these ideas can significantly improve the organic visibility of a businesses operating locally.</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you intend to design a site or a blog you always come to the difficult question of choosing a domain name. Your domain is your digital address. Even if you have the best-looking design, if you get the wrong address, you could lose visitors before they’ve even seen your website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how do you choose the best domain name for your website?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will try to provide some practical advice for registering a professional website name.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Associate the domain name with that of the site </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is more common for blogs than for corporate sites, however, in principle, it is good to match the domain to the site name to encourage research and SEO benefits. The main reason for this choice is simple: people search according to the name they remember; if the name and domain coincide, then you’re in business!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Choose website URL’s that are easy to remember. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ideal scenario in choosing the perfect domain is to be able to find a short name, so you avoid the risk of a typo, but also making it easy to remember. Web addresses with these characteristics are easily recognisable and easy to pass to others. The advice that is usually given is not to exceed names consisting of 2-3 words.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choose a few and pick the easiest to remember!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Check availability first </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It often happens that you want to register a domain with a name that is not associated with any site but is not available because it has already been purchased by another person or service that registers common addresses and then resells them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this case, there are two possibilities: contact the owner of the domain name and try to purchase it or look for the availability of a domain with the same name but with a different extension, for example, .com or .net if the .UK is not available.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Add brands and keywords </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This tip is perhaps the most fundamental and there are several schools of thought that advocate using multiple keywords within the domain name while others prefer to work on SEO and choose a generic domain that appeals to the brand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advice is to use the business as a first choice, especially if it has a strong and easy-to-remember name while falling back on the keywords in case of unavailability, or in the presence of a niche sector in which certain keywords are part of the common terminology.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Analyse the competition </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As often happens in any sector, understanding your main competitors can be of great help in making the right decisions for our business. If most of them use their brand name as a domain name, it is beneficial not to go out of your way to be unconventional or too quirky; customers may be confused and choose our competitor because they find it more appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. Choose the extension</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of domain extension must be evaluated according to the business objectives. E-commerce often uses .com domains as they have more international significance. On the other hand, UK users often feel a greater sense of security when visiting a .UK domain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best advice, however, is this: if you don't have budgetary constraints, it's always good to choose different extensions associated with the same domain name. For example, choose domainname.UK, domainname.com and domainname.net while keeping only one site active.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. Avoid hyphens (if you can) </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are pros and cons to using hyphens in your domain name. If the desired domain has already been taken, the use of the same name broken by a dash could be a valid alternative. However, BEWARE, there is the risk of users forgetting to put a hyphen and ending up at your competitor’s site!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finding the perfect domain name is like finding the perfect shirt to match your trousers. Apart from taking time and effort, ultimately, the one that works best for your business and best with your users will inevitably not match up perfectly. But, by following these eight tips, you will be sure to have a domain name that will (as much as possible) match you and your users and last for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating content is fundamental if you want to improve your SEO or online marketing because it allows you to create direct contact with readers, demonstrate your knowledge and gain their trust. However, when running a blog, for example, sometimes you can get caught with writer's block, or just don’t know where to start.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who dedicate themselves to digital marketing and writing blogs know how important creating an editorial plan is, and producing new content at a constant pace without ever falling below a certain qualitative threshold and losing interest from their audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are a few quick-fire ways to arm yourself with information or ideas that can help you put pen to paper.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Google tools and SEO tools to research topics&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing a post without a purpose is wasted time, and if you haven't done the research on how to choose and position keywords on the page, you won't be able to intercept readers in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, try to imagine your ideal reader and think about what they might be interested in: what are the solutions you can offer? How can you make their life better?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have an idea for a new topic, imagine how your reader would search for it on the internet and type the phrase into Google. The words you used for the search are your starting keywords and are valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, try them in the Google Trends search bar to see how interesting they are, or search for related words with the free Google Ads tools. You have to get to the content people are looking for, with the words and language they usually use.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google's basic tools are a necessary resource; anyone who writes for the web should use them. Even the unassuming hints Google shows you while you're typing a phrase into the search field are valuable clues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also paid tools with advanced features, such as SEOZoom and other free keyword research tools that can help.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Your customers are the editorial plan!&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The editorial plan of a business blog is nothing more than what your customers want. The trick is then to think about your buyers/visitors and start building a profile. Who are your customers? Age, gender, interests, behaviours, internet browsing habits etc. Perhaps talk to your sales department or customer care team and you will find an avalanche of questions on which to organise an editorial plan!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing with the intent to help and offer solutions to specific needs enhances your knowledge and offers a useful service to people. This attitude turns into an exchange that enriches your content offering and increases your authority online.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Involve employees and stakeholders&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To identify interesting and engaging content for users which allows you to increase web traffic and plenty of clicks and “likes” on your corporate blog, a winning move is to involve employees and stakeholders (suppliers, distributors, key customers). With their suggestions and ideas, you can enrich your initial knowledge and find new and brilliant ideas to organise an amazing editorial plan built around your business and those who frequently engage with it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Your competition&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re not suggesting that you copy what others are doing, but take a cue from more successful companies/content creators. Also, in your sector, there will certainly be a company that acts as a reference point for everyone. Here, their social pages and their blogs are a great tool to find ideas to replicate on your pages, obviously without copying, but writing new, fresh content, with the style that distinguishes you and with your own point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>To conclude&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than relying on inspiration on a day-to-day basis and falling behind, try to structure an editorial plan towards the short/medium term by trying a few of the ideas that we have listed in the article.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nowadays, online shopping reviews will greatly influence a user's decision on whether or not to purchase a particular product or service. Often, users will make a bee-line for the reviews section for confidence that the product they’re buying is legitimate and of sound quality.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, have you ever thought about how to improve your online reviews to consequently grow your business?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this short article, we'll give you some interesting insights into why they are so important for the growth of your business and how to ask for reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why use customer reviews to grow your business?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having satisfied customers is too precious a resource not to exploit it and consequently increase the growth and success of any business!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But why are online reviews so important for getting new customers? It is very simple to explain:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Building Trust&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a product or service is recommended by one or more people who have actually tried it, potential customers feel calmer and are more likely to buy it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Positive reviews that highlight the qualities of your work have a major impact on your professional image. A potential customer reading positive reviews about you will feel more comfortable trusting you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Increase Conversion Rate&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all users who visit your website are ready to buy right away. They often need to figure out if what you are offering is really right for them. This is why the strategic use of a review can make a significant contribution to pushing the consumer to choose you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Customer Insights&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By listening to the opinion of those who use your services, you can collect interesting ideas to improve your work and demonstrate that you are a serious company or professional who knows how to listen to their customers and wants to improve.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Improve SEO&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They improve SEO if you get positive reviews on different platforms, the SEO of your site will benefit a lot and more customers will be able to find you easily on the internet. It is important to remember to insert the website link in the profile (for example on the Facebook page or Google My Business).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tips for increasing your customer reviews&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we've seen, positive reviews are a lifesaver for your business. Let’s have a look at some of the best ways to increase your customer reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Design a custom template&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best ways you can start getting positive reviews is to be able to contact old customers who have used your company and it must be written in a way that is clear, direct and easily understandable. During the drafting of the email, customers should be treated in a subjective and personal way. It may be useful to add some details that relate to the relationship between the customer and the company in question yet still appeal to a wide number of people – you don’t want to write individual emails!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ask to leave a review at the end of their journey&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asking for a review at the end of the customer journey is certainly a great way to collect the so-called "hot opinions". Being a time when customers' enthusiasm is at its peak, it will be easier for them to leave positive reviews. These include a link within them that can be used to direct customers to the place where you want to receive reviews. This function will be used by people to be able to express an opinion about their experience discreetly.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Offer customers something in exchange&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another popular strategy is to offer customers an incentive to write a review about your business. This is a very useful way to increase your success and strengthen your relationship with them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most used method is certainly to offer a discount on the next purchase or booking. Both positive and negative reviews will come, but every single piece of feedback is very important to understand what your weaknesses are, and how to improve them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create posts and stay active on social media&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way that can lead people to write positive reviews about your company is to stay active on social media. The people who follow the account on social media are generally interested in the products and the brand in question, so it is possible that any customer, after having had a positive experience with the company, will be inclined to leave a positive comment. The post you create has to get people to comment – why not users a question about your product?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Be present on multiple online platforms&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to website reviews, customers very often expect to find answers to their questions across multiple platforms, such as Google Facebook, TripAdvisor and many more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this reason, it is essential to be present on the main platforms used in relation to your business because you will increase your audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reviews are vital in an effective and solid web marketing strategy. Getting reviews from people can be a challenge that requires energy, time, dedication and the desire to improve things. It's also good to consider that there may be times when things don't go quite as they should, but that's not a good reason to give up or throw in the towel - the key to success is consistency and persistence. A good&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>These days, anyone can create a website, but only a few can boast a truly effective website. What does an&nbsp;<em>“effective website"</em>&nbsp;mean and what are the characteristics that distinguish it from an&nbsp;<em>"ineffective"</em>&nbsp;one?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we will try to provide you with some simple, but useful information which you can use to benchmark whether your site is effective and if it is not, how to address certain issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Go for clean graphics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simplicity, minimalism, linearity are the key concepts that dominate web design trends. Many sites tend to favour content over images, but the importance of using quality photos should be emphasised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colours and photos must be well balanced, clear and incisive. The use of poor-quality graphics and content will cause users to never return to your website. It is therefore, absolutely necessary to show high quality images to influence a potential customer's purchase decision and improve the overall quality of your ecommerce site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember that images make a huge difference!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Clarity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the user doesn't know what to expect after clicking on a link or doesn't know where to click to find the information they are looking for, it will cause in them to leave your site. So, make sure you create a website that is easy for users to navigate and understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of clear and intuitive categories and labels serves to communicate what your business is dedicated to. From the first moment, users will know they are in the right place and how to find the information they are looking for. Pay particular attention to the phrases and language you use to communicate with users, in order to facilitate their search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your goal, when you decide to create an effective website, is to translate your&nbsp;<em>potential</em>&nbsp;leads into customers, and to sell, you need to attract a lot of people to your site.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This won’t be possible if you do not carry out good SEO practice, allowing you to improve visibility of the website rankings on search engines. The higher you are positioned within these engines, the greater your chances of getting noticed in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Write useful content for your users</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Website content writing</strong>&nbsp;must be of quality, original and relevant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is nothing worse than boring, uninteresting, soulless&nbsp;<strong>web content</strong>, so, avoid copying and pasting from the corporate brochure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always ask yourself what your users want and think about what they might find interesting. Answering their questions with relevant and clear answers is your goal. If your responses are appreciated, people will be happy to share your content on their social channels.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Presence on Social Networks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another essential factor to increase the effectiveness of your site is to increase your presence on&nbsp;<strong>social media platforms&nbsp;</strong>like, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creation of a page will allow people to trace your website even more, sharing information and content too and will connect directly to your site, allowing greater visibility.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you want to get more involved, you can create real sponsored campaigns to gain visibility, engagement or visits. One of the social networks that allows you to do this Facebook Ads.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CTA marketing</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most important points: whether it is the "buy", "subscribe" or "contact us" button, it must be positioned wisely, because it is the&nbsp;<strong>call to action on a website&nbsp;</strong>that actually converts a visitor into a lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A CTA allows the user to enter an area that you have designated for them; a landing page, an information page or a page to fill in the data for a contact request.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From your point of view, calls to action are really important, because they allow you to guide the visitor in the direction you want and to offer content made especially for them. The CTA must also stand out visually and stand out from the rest of the page, perhaps with a different colour or a particular font.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We hope that these tips will provide you with a starting point towards tackling the design and effectiveness of your website and guiding you towards a more modern, more successful and professional online business.</strong></p>

<p>Search Engine Optimisation, better known by the acronym of SEO - is a digital marketing discipline that uses on-site and off-site strategies to&nbsp;<strong>drive traffic to your website</strong>, based on ranking in popular search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. With the growing importance of an&nbsp;<strong>online content strategy</strong>, it is crucial today to resort to SEO writing in blog posts by using it in the best possible way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Publishing articles written with&nbsp;<strong>SEO-friendly writing</strong>&nbsp;on your blog will help you generate a better return on investment (ROI) for your content. This short guide to posting&nbsp;<strong>SEO content</strong>&nbsp;will help you rank your blog and drive quality traffic to your page in no time!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5><strong>3 simple steps to effective SEO content writing</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Article writing topics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you start applying search engine optimised content on your blog, you should first find the right topic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You could write the most interesting article in the world, but if it has nothing to do with your business or the other content on your blog, you will most likely be disappointed in achieving the desired results. Creating an all-encompassing strategy around content is an important step in building a successful blog and finding ideas that can fall under the umbrella of that strategy is a crucial step in selecting the topics to be covered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Writing for SEO</strong></em><em>&nbsp;must be based on Keyword research&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keyword research is the process of using SEO tools such as SEMrush or the Google Ads keyword planner to better understand keyword trends in your industry. In other words, you will need to use these tools to check how frequently and to what extent people search for specific terms in search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you may find that people search for "best dog food" more often than "cheap dog food". Which might allow you to write an article like "Best food for Poodles" instead of "Cheapest food for Poodles".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Write SEO-friendly content</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all have a different approach to writing, and there is nothing right or wrong about the technique someone uses when writing a blog article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some guidelines for writing an optimised article:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create a frame for the article&nbsp;- With no goal in mind, create a small frame of topics you want to cover in your post. Most articles have an introduction and conclusion with several supportive details in between. The format will obviously depend on your style, topic, but creating a frame will definitely help you keep the right focus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Introduction -&nbsp;The introduction is one of the most important parts of the article, especially when we consider&nbsp;<strong>SEO article writing</strong>. From the perspective of SEO blog writing, you should enter the selected keywords (in particular the main keyword) smoothly in the introduction of your article to signal its presence to search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use titles and subtitles -&nbsp;Using headings for different paragraphs is a great way to quickly communicate something relevant about the topic to search engine crawlers, as well as a great way to improve the readability of the article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Include internal and external links&nbsp;- Links are an important signal for search engines. When you find yourself writing an article, use internal links (i.e. links to other articles on your site) and external links when necessary. You should link internal pages and resources that are relevant to what is written in your article to help&nbsp;<strong>improve the search ranking</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read, edit and revise&nbsp;- Don't be afraid to have someone else read your draft so you have some input about it. It might also be helpful to rely on an experienced editor to check your content for both grammatical and syntactic errors. It is much easier to correct errors before the article is published than after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Optimise your post before publishing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the content itself, the title is the second most important thing for the optimisation of the post. It is important to include keywords in the title, preferably at the beginning. Since the title is shown first in the search results, it is also essential to write an appealing one that can entice users to click on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The URL is another often underrated element that can significantly improve your ranking. Make sure the keywords are also present in the article URL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congratulations! Once the article is published, you will need to spend some time actively promoting it and generating off-site signals to further improve your ranking for the selected keywords.</p>

<p>You don't need to be an expert to understand that one of the keys to increasing e-commerce sales is knowing your customers and understanding who they are. However, this data remains useless if it is not used constantly to improve the customer experience. Therefore, really getting to know your users and their needs is valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how do you&nbsp;<strong>identify customer needs</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Communicate with them</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make it easy to contact for help, information or insights on each page of your shop. Show your "community" that customer service is irreproachable and always offers a solution. Be responsive by proposing the possibility to modify the product, promotional code, free shipping, etc. Invest in customer care and communicate with customers through the various channels: web, blog, social network, newsletter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always appreciate the opinions and comments of reviews, interact with them, including those that are anything but flattering! If you respond appropriately, criticism can be used to&nbsp;<strong>improve your brand</strong>. When you get a negative opinion, treat it as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Insights Gathering Tools</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google Analytics is a free service made available by Google to monitor its website. If you've never used this tool before, it would be useful to briefly learn&nbsp;<strong>how to use Google Analytics</strong>&nbsp;to find a large amount of information relating to visitors to your site and their behaviour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sections that are worth checking out if you want to start learning more about your users are Audience and Acquisition. In the first, you can find detailed demographic information, but also data regarding the interests of your visitors, while in the acquisition section you can find where they come from:&nbsp;<strong>organic search</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>PPC campaigns</strong>, social, etc. This type of information can help you understand more about your users' habits and behaviours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook has access to an impressive amount of information about its users. The Insight section available for fan pages allows you to have access to this and other data concerning the page itself, such as detailed information on “Likes”, on the coverage of posts, actions performed on posts, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Online Poll</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the easiest ways to better understand who your users are is to ask questions directly to them. If you have a website or are still present online on other channels, there are some tools you can use to get information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surveymonkey is one of the most popular tools used for&nbsp;<strong>designing an online survey</strong>, which allows you to reach the recipients of the survey on the web, via email or on social networks. The functionalities of this tool do not end once the answers are obtained: tools for targeted analysis are available that allow you to obtain interesting information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SurveyMonkey also provides a database of ready-made questions from which to draw when you build your survey.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"textColor":"vivid-red"} -->
<p class="has-text-color has-vivid-red-color">Or why not turn to Social Media and try a good old Instagram Poll on your Instagram Stories? Quick and effective!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>See how your customers behave</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing how your customers speak is great, but people often say one thing and do another. You'll get the greatest insights of all by observing&nbsp;<strong>online consumer behaviour</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check how customers use your website with Google Analytics - Google Analytics shows you where your customers come from to reach your website and how they move through your website. Additionally, it can be set to show what percentage of your visitors become buyers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will learn a lot about what your customers want from the search terms they use to get to your site. All of this is valuable information that helps you understand your customers better.</p>

<h3><em>5 TIPS to improve your Local SEO</em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mastering&nbsp;<strong>how to get on the first page of Google</strong>&nbsp;is the ultimate goal for most companies. But more important than ranking first overall, is to appear first,&nbsp;<em>locally</em>. That is why Local SEO and Google's Local algorithm are increasingly important and ways to improve local SEO should be your main focus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local SEO is very important to bear in mind for companies, especially for those that operate within a strong territory or competition. Having good Local SEO positioning on Google allows your company to appear visible, possibly in the first pages, to every user who carries out a localised search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some useful tips to improve the local ranking of your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>1. Start with your&nbsp;<strong>Google My Business page</strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google My Business service was created by Google Plus in 2014. This platform allows a professional or company to create a profile with all the details of their business. This data will then be inserted into Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who are just beginning, the advice is to fill in all the descriptive fields trying to use the right keywords, obviously making sure that the description is written for human beings and therefore genuine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What data can be entered? The possibilities are many and to have a detailed and useful profile for Local SEO it is good to specify:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Description of the activity</li><li>Commercial category to which you belong</li><li>Pictures related to the activity</li><li>Opening/closing times</li><li>Address</li><li>Telephone number</li><li>Mail</li><li>Reviews of users</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all probability, you may have neglected this area of local SEO optimisation - from the lack of contact information to the inclusion in the wrong categories which alienate the really interested leads. Fortunately, this is all easily fixed and learning how to create Google My Business page is easy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>2. Use other&nbsp;<strong>online directories</strong>&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are portals and platforms where you can enter the URL of your and information about your business for free. Users very often rely on these as business directories, because they are considered safe and free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some popular directories are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Apple Maps</li><li>Yellow Pages</li><li>Foursquare</li><li>Yahoo's Localworks&nbsp;</li><li>Google Places</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being featured in these directories can have a big impact on your ranking. In addition to directories, it is useful to have good reviews on other sites such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Yelp</li><li>Glassdoor</li><li>TripAdvisor</li><li>Hot Frog</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are very popular sites, where people can leave comments and reviews about different types of local businesses. Keep in mind that one of the most important factors in ranking your business is positive reviews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, according to Google, high-quality reviews can significantly improve your online visibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>3. NAP</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not the sleeping “NAP” you’re thinking about - NAP (name and place) refers to information about your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When filling out your forms, you must always check that you have entered consistent information in all the lists in which you are present on the web.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google cares about its credibility and it is vital that the information is accurate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your name, address, and phone number must match on all profiles to make it easier for customers to connect with your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>4. Keyword research for Local SEO&nbsp;</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research your company’s keywords- but,&nbsp;<strong><em>what keywords should you use? How many keywords should you use</em></strong><em>?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t worry! Google Keyword Planner can help you</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Enter keywords that are relevant to your business and that will be found by local users</li><li>Monitor the search volume of your keywords</li><li>Monitor the degree of difficulty and relevance of keywords.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Implementing this type of research and keeping it active over time allows companies to always be ready to respond to hypothetical requests from users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>5. Generate fresh content</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engines favour sites that offer frequent updates in their content. This means that if your site stays the same for months, it won't get good results from a positioning point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to always have new content is to&nbsp;<strong>learn how to create a blog</strong>&nbsp;and constantly insert new content. This blog should be on the company website and not in a separate site.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using the keywords, you’ve researched about your company, now would be a good time to begin using them by entering the necessary keywords according to the rules of&nbsp;<a href="https://elevateom.com/how-to-create-the-perfect-blog-content-that-converts-into-sales/">SEO copywriting</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing organic website traffic is not an easy thing to accomplish but it’s is not impossible - by investing a bit of time and commitment, and a few successful strategies, you’ll generate more traffic in no time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at 3 ways we can do this and understand why it’s important to work hard on these aspects and improve them:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Gain valuable links to your content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Use internal links – Internal links help Google understand the context and relationships between the different articles on your website. It then uses this information as classification signals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have accumulated a decent amount of content for SEO, you can cite it on your blog and your website, guiding visitors to more relevant content marketing. This can keep visitors on your website longer, which helps improve search engine rankings. However, don't abuse internal links - using too many of them could make your content look like spam.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend that you make a habit of linking to your older articles in your new articles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Search for keywords - SEO tools are essential for identifying various parameters related to your site. Backlinks, competitors, keywords etc. They can be collected by these tools and this information is useful for classifying your website and, ultimately, for positioning the site on Google.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Find Influencers - There are several ways to find influencers in your sector. Google gives you access to a large online database. Plus, you can find the right influencer for your niche on Youtube, an ideal platform for influencer marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another tool you can use to search for influencers is a link analysis tool. By checking the *backlinks of your competitors, you can understand where the traffic is coming from and find influencers in your sector.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*A backlink is an inbound link to your content from an external website. Backlinks are one of the most influential signals in Google rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep your content fresh&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is your website full of old content that has stopped attracting visitors? If so, you may be able to revitalise this content by updating it for the current year!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is constantly evolving and if your site only has old content, you won't attract results. The following changes can boost a page's search ranking quickly:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Update of the year in the page title, for example, change from “hottest trends of 2019” to “hottest trends of 2020”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Correction of any broken links in the content&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Updating outdated screenshots&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Using statistics for the current year&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Correction of broken images&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>· Make sure your content stays up to date. It doesn't take long and can make a big difference to your site!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Indexed Pages&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common mistake is to confuse "indexing" with "ranking".&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The are two related but completely different things!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By indexing on search engines, we mean “making a website or blog visible among the results that a search engine returns (regardless of position)”.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By positioning, on the other hand, we mean " all those techniques aimed at making a website in the best possible position among the results for certain keywords ".&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indexing is the basis (without that you can't rank anything), ranking comes next and is about the ability to get your site or page up among the top positions on Google or other search engines. Pages must be indexed on Google correctly, using the Google Webmaster Tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating a website means creating a point of reference for customers and visitors, so, having an outdated website means losing out on valuable opportunities and in the worst-case scenario creating damage to the image of your brand. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An outdated site, lacking information and without interesting and updated content will lead users to leave, changing the perception they had of your business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With just a few simple ideas and regular “website-health” check-ups, you will ensure that visitors are seeing the best version of your website, increasing your chances for success with each click.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"large"} -->
<p class="has-large-font-size">Update Content regularly&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hear&nbsp;quite&nbsp;often: “content is king”, and this famous phrase embodies the importance of the role of content within every&nbsp;content marketing&nbsp;strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A constantly updated website represents a communication channel with great potential, a space where you can best tell your story,&nbsp;what you do,&nbsp;and above all,&nbsp;what sets you apart from the rest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"large"} -->
<p class="has-large-font-size">The Importance of Usability&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all&nbsp;know the feeling of frustration when you want to access a site and it is slow to load&nbsp;-&nbsp;As a user,&nbsp;it will have happened to you countless times and you will be familiar with the instinct to leave the website immediately.&nbsp;In addition to the content, a winning website must be developed&nbsp;towards those who&nbsp;will use it; in other words, it must be able to combine an attractive and recognisable design with&nbsp;good&nbsp;usability for the target audience.&nbsp;Only then will your website be&nbsp;successful,&nbsp;and&nbsp;your audience&nbsp;will be able to get the most out of it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>You can ask  yourself a few  questions that will help you understand where you need to make usability improvements: </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>How is the page loading speed?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li>Are the texts understandable and do they communicate the message promptly?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3"><li>Are the calls to action clear and visible?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4"><li>Is the menu well structured?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} -->
<ol start="5"><li>Is the user's path hindered or does it run smoothly to purchase?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":6} -->
<ol start="6"><li>Are there any errors or other slowdowns?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":7} -->
<ol start="7"><li>Are the pages mobile friendly?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<br>It’s&nbsp;crucial to make sure that your site does not present these problems, considering the limited time available to the&nbsp;visitor and the difficulty in capturing their attention.&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, if your site is too slow, it will be penalised by Google in&nbsp;page&nbsp;rankings, as speed is one of the fundamental factors for correct indexing. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"large"} -->
<p class="has-large-font-size">Keep your website updated&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From&nbsp;the&nbsp;images of the products&nbsp;you sell&nbsp;to the graphics of the site itself, everything must be up-to-date and pleasant, with professional care. Would you go shopping at a store whose owner&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;bother fixing the broken window?&nbsp;Perhaps not.&nbsp;The same goes for&nbsp;your website.&nbsp;Your&nbsp;website is&nbsp;a&nbsp;showcase&nbsp;of the products and/or services&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;offering, take care of it and keep it updated&nbsp;and you’ll have visitors returning.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s no surprise that selling through social media is BIG business -&nbsp;<em>30% of online shoppers worldwide say they shop on social media (Big Commerce, 2019)</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an opportunity to be exploited since nowadays social networks like Facebook and Instagram offer the necessary tools to better attract with your ideal customers and sell your products directly through these platforms. For some years now,&nbsp;social-selling&nbsp;has&nbsp;been seen as&nbsp;a standard concept for developing online sales.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re looking to increase your sales through social media, perhaps these ideas can help:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":24} -->
<p style="font-size:24px"><strong>Which social networks to sell through?  </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a range of different social networks, we have Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and many others. You will certainly have to choose the ones that best suit your audience, this is the vital first step; know where your customers go to find the products and services they’re looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’ve nailed down your preferred social network, you will have to produce a plan to create and then share content that is really of strong interest to your target audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and others offer advertising tools to get the content you previously produced to the attention of a new audience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":24} -->
<p style="font-size:24px"><strong>Engage potential buyers with quality content </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a content and social media marketing strategy makes it easy to build relationships with the brand's potential customers. Social users, and the internet in general, are bombarded daily by thousands of different messages and have a very low threshold of attention in this regard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your content must therefore be designed according to the specific needs of your target audience, to create messages that are as personalised as possible to capture attention.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing all this is certainly not easy, but we are not talking about an impossible task. There are some steps you need to focus on. Read our blog on some tips on how to do this:&nbsp;<a href="https://elevateom.com/want-to-write-better-social-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://elevateom.com/want-to-write-better-social-content/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":24} -->
<p style="font-size:24px"><strong>Participate in conversations </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The interaction of a seller on social media should move from their posts to those shared by other users (or sellers, if you prefer). B2B decision-makers are in fact more likely to engage with a salesperson who demonstrates knowledge about them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It, therefore, becomes important to look carefully for the conversations to participate in, considering how some value can be added to the discussion while increasing the brand’s awareness&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's where to find conversations to participate in and get noticed:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>News Feeds</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook and LinkedIn groups are excellent places to interact with potential customers. Engaging with positive comments on your Facebook page is a great way to build rapport.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hashtags</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>i.e.&nbsp;related to your products or industry. By searching for them, you will be able to find conversations and posts about related topics and give you opportunities to promote yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Influencers</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will allow you to take advantage of your visibility on social media, thus bringing your brand to the attention of a greater number of users.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":24} -->
<p style="font-size:24px"><strong>Paid content </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have you considered paid content?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic concept of a paid content is the same for all Social Media: a text + image post is created that promotes a product/service and a certain budget is assigned to it to reach a certain number of users for a certain&nbsp;period of time. The advertising post will appear in the newsfeed of users who will be invited (through an effective Call to Action) to carry out an action, which could consist of visiting the website, subscribing to a newsletter, finding out more information about a product, landing on a landing page and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The huge advantage of paid social media posts is that they can be focussed towards a highly targeted audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;creating content, a major challenge is getting eyes on your posts, and knowing when to publish your content isn’t always easy. In this article, we are going to help you answer the question "When to post on social networks?" and give you the tools to find out what tone to give the conversation to capture potential customers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Create A Content Plan</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A social media plan mixes content topics and user needs in a balanced way –&nbsp;Don’t&nbsp;just think advertising, think of more interesting user-led topics and content that will be enjoyable for your potential visitors to engage with. If you have an editorial plan, you will not find yourself publishing exclusively advertising posts. The idea is to create engagement&nbsp;<strong>around</strong>&nbsp;your brand or your products and not just&nbsp;<strong>about</strong>&nbsp;them, this can only be achieved by being original and providing your users with an incentive that pushes them to follow you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How often to post on Social Networks? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's&nbsp;move on to the inexact science of the times to publish on social media&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, there are thousands of statistics around on the perfect time to post on social networks, these are not entirely wrong but at the same time must be taken as purely indicative to carrying out more precise tests. Let's&nbsp;look at them:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When to post on Instagram?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get the most engagement on your Instagram posts, you need to share content when your audience is most likely to engage with it. Luckily, users on Instagram have very similar habits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media platform statistics showed 12 million Instagram posts in multiple time zones from accounts ranging from 100 to 1 million+ followers. They showed that, generally, the best time to post on Instagram was Wednesday between 1 pm and 3 pm GMT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When to post on Twitter?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best results, according to statistics, are obtained from Monday to Saturday, in the hours ranging from 07:00 to 9:00 in the morning or even from 13:00 to 14:00 or from 17:00 to 18:00. The peak of greatest interest occurs on Monday and Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When to post on Facebook?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, according to the statistics, the best results are obtained from Monday to Thursday, with particular attention to Wednesday, where the highest peak of engagement is recorded between&nbsp;15:00 and 19:00. The best times to post on the remaining days would appear to be around 12 pm, 1 pm, 2 pm, 5 pm or 6 pm.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When to post on LinkedIn?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this case, as LinkedIn is more B2B focussed, the best results would be obtained between Tuesday and Thursday, the best times are between 07:00 and 09:00 in the morning or between 12:00 and 14: 00 in the early afternoon or between 17:00 and 18:00. Probably due to the work breaks of professionals and general work hours.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use the tips in this guide to create engaging content and publish at the best times, tracking performance as you go. Soon&nbsp;you’ll&nbsp;have a good idea of your user’s habits which will make future social marketing campaigns easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The short answer – YES! But there are rules (just a&nbsp;few..)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, let's clarify the subject of today's guide.  A <strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong> is an official announcement sent to news agencies and journalists to inform them of important news or event. Since the purpose is to help journalists compose an article, its title should contain an action word and the first paragraph should provide a summary of the content. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A<strong> press release </strong>should also be succinct, generally speaking of a page or two, written in clear language. The aim is to provide enough detail to the news media to run a story based on the ad. This is why you should not only consider them as a means of media coverage but also as real elements of content marketing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Creating a Press Release</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some opportunities for a press release:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• promotion or hiring of a new corporate executive </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• rebranding </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• awarding of a prize </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• introduction of a partnership or opening of a new office </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• launch of a new product or substantial update of an existing one </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pick a catchy title</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use a verb (an action word) to produce an interesting, punchy but short title. You need to get the reporter to read the release, so invest time in choosing the title if necessary. Don't&nbsp;forget to make it SEO friendly and make sure you include your main keywords in the title so that it is explanatory of the content and optimised for search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Make it clear what it is</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start with the place and date of sending the press release in bold. Then use the first paragraph to describe in a concise but complete way the subject of the press release.  Many will not go beyond the first paragraph, so eliminate unnecessary elements and communicate the news directly.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Learn how to write engaging and search engine optimised content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://elevateom.com/want-to-write-better-social-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>READ THE GUIDE</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Offer a quote</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember the primary audience you're&nbsp;targeting:&nbsp;media professionals, who hopefully use the press release to write an article or report the news. Having data or a quote from key people for your&nbsp;business is valuable content that is easy to share. Include a key quote or two that serve to emphasise the ad content.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Don't</strong><strong>&nbsp;forget the contact information and pictures</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last paragraph is the one most likely to be cut off. Use it to include less necessary information, such as insights, brief company history, additional links, and contact details (first and last name, phone number, website,&nbsp;email&nbsp;and social media account).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Include high-quality images as well, so journalists&nbsp;don't&nbsp;have to waste time searching for them and can choose the one they like best. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sharing a Press Release</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once&nbsp;you've&nbsp;proofread the press release thoroughly, to make sure it is understandable, error-free, and that all links are working correctly, it's time to think about getting it out there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Send the press release via email to the various journalists, pasting it directly into the body of the message. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li>Create a list of journalists to <strong>send your press release to</strong>. Select those experts in your sector or area, to contact with a personalised message. </li></ol>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3"><li>Try to differentiate yourself using alternative channels to contact journalists who are bombarded with an avalanche of mail every day.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4"><li>Don't&nbsp;post your ad on the stroke of a new hour. Many distribution companies and services schedule publications on the hour. Try distributing it at less usual times.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} -->
<ol start="5"><li>If your press release is used to write some articles or is mentioned in the media, share these stories on your social networks to increase the visibility of your brand.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In essence, a press release can really help boost your SEO, but remember to make it newsworthy,&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;and interesting!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The loading time of your website is incredibly important to any online business&nbsp;and&nbsp;can make or break your web traffic, and vastly change the level of sales your business converts. We live in an age of instant-gratification, and customers are increasingly impatient. A slow loading webpage can be all it takes for a potential customer to click away, losing you a business opportunity. Monitoring and bettering your website load times should be a key part of your website development, as it has the potential to make or break your online marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;Google search algorithm is constantly evolving and improving. It is designed to promote websites&nbsp;that prioritise user-experience, due to which it prioritises what it deems the ‘highest-quality’ websites in its result ranking. The factors the algorithm uses to determine what constitutes a ‘high quality’ webpage changes over time, and one of the latest editions relates to website load times. In 2020,&nbsp;Google added the ‘core website vitals’ factor, something which is in part determined by the time it takes a website to load. It is generally believed that 3 seconds or less is the ideal website load time to maintain customer interest. The problem with this? The majority of websites take far longer than this to load, especially on mobile, which consistently takes longer than desktop due to a lower processing capability.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effect of load time on your business website may come as a surprise, indeed it is something you may have never thought to consider before. If your website is hosted by a low-quality website hosting provider, it may also be one of the key problems your online marketing is facing. The first step to creating a faster website load time is in finding out what your current load time is. There are a variety of tools available online to check your website load time. You should carry this test out on both mobile and desktop, in order to access how well your webpage loading is performing on both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a different mobile and desktop site layout can be a simple way to speed up slow mobile website load times, especially important when so many customers will be accessing your business webpage from their phone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you identify that your website has a slow loading time, it is best to work with a web developer to get it down to that ideal 3 seconds or less. They will be able to work with you to redesign your website in a way that prioritises load time. This can be achieved through a number of tactics, like reducing redirects, changing image size, utilising effective website links, and prioritising the loading speed of your most high-performing webpages, and the webpages you expect your customer to click on most frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the simplest ways to create a better webpage load speed is to change to a higher quality website hosting platform. Through improving your webpage loading speed, you make your business far more accessible to your&nbsp;customers and&nbsp;help to increase your online engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

After months of tweaking your webpages, working on key words, and prioritising search engine optimisation, you finally watch your webpage climb the ranks. It is like trying to climb a mountain, and after months of perseverance, and planning, you have done it. You have achieved online marketing success, and your business is reaping the rewards. Then suddenly, you notice you are falling down again, and your website has lost that all important&nbsp;page&nbsp;ranking spot you worked so hard to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest problem here is the way in which we think about the rankings.&nbsp;Google rankings are not a static thing, a task you work hard at and achieve. The main reason that your business website has fallen down the&nbsp;Google search rankings is because the internet is not a static place. It can feel like a real landscape, as sure and difficult to traverse as any mountain range, but it is ultimately an evolving series of code. Your website needs to be able to evolve and adapt, as does your social media marketing strategy, in order to keep up with an evolving platform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all remember the old days of dial-up internet, with its clunky user interfaces, and long wait times. This old internet seems a world away from the sleek and speedy search engines of today. The truth is that even today, the internet is growing and changing, and will be entirely different in the years to come. Every modern business wants and needs a successful online presence, and it can be disheartening to see your website drop down&nbsp;the Google rankings. Unfortunately, something as simple as a tweaking of the&nbsp;Google algorithm, or a development in technology can cause&nbsp;many&nbsp;issues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, more and more businesses are becoming aware of the power of online marketing and trying to use it effectively as part of their business strategy. This means that more and more websites are popping up every day, and your business website could move down the&nbsp;Google rankings today due to a website that just didn’t exist yesterday. It is important not to get complacent when it comes to your online marketing. Search engine optimisation is an active, ongoing process, that needs to change with the changing landscape of computer-mediated communication. The more internet savvy we get, the more effort needs to go into an effective online marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important factor is one that has always existed. Businesses have always had to traverse the changing times, even before the invention of the internet. The wants and needs of your customers are always changing and updating, and businesses need to change with it. You can fall down the&nbsp;Google rankings simply because what people were searching for yesterday just isn’t what they are looking for today. A successful business must keep up to date with the changing times, understanding and meeting the evolving needs of their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At worst, blog content can be a forgotten section of a business website, seldom engaged with, and often overlooked. At best, it has the potential to be a key website feature increasing engagement, widening your audience, and driving sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mastering your blog content is key to ensuring it creates conversions and facilitates business success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating engaging, inspiring, and useful blog writing ultimately comes down to two key issues;&nbsp;blog pages need to be user-friendly, and useful. By maximising the usability of your website, and the quality of your content, you can be sure that your blog posts convert into results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read on for&nbsp;key advice when it comes to your business’ online marketing strategy&nbsp;and&nbsp;how to make&nbsp;blog writing&nbsp;convert to sales.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Creating useful blog writing content</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above all else, your blog content should be useful, readable, and engaging. This is how you can ensure it is useful to your customers, and in turn that it directs them to your business. From the title to the closing line, your content should be optimised to ensure customer engagement. There are a few ways to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, your blog title should be something that will drive engagement. This could be by using a question that a customer is likely to type into a search engine, or by utilising a degree of clickbait. A title should be snappy and entice a website visitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this comes with warning. An engaging title without an engaging article is one of the surest ways to lose a customer before they get to the end, and before your blog marketing content has chance to convert. If your blog title is a question, then your blog content needs to answer it. If you use click bait in the title, the article must deliver what was promised on the tin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When writing a blog post, always keep your audience in mind. Any blog writing needs to be simply and accessibly written. You are an expert on your business and your industry, and it can be easy to get swept away in the years of knowledge and use specific jargon that someone not in the industry just might not be aware of.&nbsp;Always write with&nbsp;your audience in&nbsp;mind and&nbsp;write at a level any person new to your&nbsp;business&nbsp;would easily understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The finishing touch to a perfect blog is a well-integrated call to action. The call to action is a feature that ensures customers don’t just read your blog writing, but instead engage with it, and your company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Creating usable blog webpage design</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So now you have a well-written blog that is sure to keep your customer interested. The next step is ensuring that interest converts into engagement, and this is achievable through webpage design.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should always develop webpages with the user in&nbsp;mind and&nbsp;test your layout on a variety of mobile and desktop devices to ensure it is always&nbsp;a user-friendly experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A call to action should be accompanied by easy to follow links that help the customer navigate your business website in the way you want them to. A sleek website design, that makes use of clear navigation links, and interesting graphics, is going to be far more engaging than a website that is disorganised or overcomplicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chat widgets can be an incredibly useful feature, helping customers to feel directly engaged with, and increasing the chance of a response.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not be afraid to utilise web design tools to ensure your blog writing is converting. Tools such as heat maps, scroll, clickthrough, and SEO data are an ideal way to check whether your content is doing its job, and creating customer engagement. Taking a look at your data overtime will help you identify what works and what doesn’t and adjust your online marketing strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of 2020, Instagram is a social media platform with over 1 billion users. This makes it the ideal place to build recognition of your brand and generate sales. Instagram marketing should be at the forefront of any business’ social media marketing strategy, especially with Instagram shopping adding a whole new arena for sales to take place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are a few things to consider when creating social media for business to ensure your business is making the most of its Instagram presence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are the most popular images on Instagram?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instagram is primarily a visual medium. This means crafting great visuals should be key to your business Instagram strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great Instagram post will have a few key features. Images should be well framed and taken with a good camera (this could be a DSLR, but a good smartphone camera will also do the trick). Saturated images perform better, and this can be achieved through basic editing using photoshop, VSCO, Canva, or even Instagram’s own editing tools. The images that are going to be the most successful are the ones that are personal to your business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When crafting an Instagram post, you should consider your business and your customer base, and tailor what you post to their interests. This is how you can drive engagement and increase your sales.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surprisingly, the most popular posts on Instagram tend to be videos, which get far more engagement than a photo post. Crafting short, engaging videos can be a great way to promote your business. Always remember to use captions, as Instagram videos are muted by default, and the first few seconds should be the most attention-grabbing. Short and sweet videos with a clear message are excellent Instagram marketing tools.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do I get more people to see my business’ Instagram posts?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instagram is an excellent platform to build a bigger audience for your business. When used effectively, it is a quick and effective method to increase your customer base, and push sales. One of the main ways to do this is through Instagram advertising, which is one of the most common online marketing strategies today. When designing your Instagram ads, make sure to put as much care and thought into these posts as your non-sponsored business posts, and prioritise customer engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another key feature of Instagram is the use of hashtags, which can help push your account to users who might not have seen it otherwise. Why not consult some of Instagram’s most popular hashtags and try to incorporate the ones that match your brand into your posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may not have yet given it a thought, but do not underestimate the power of influencer marketing. A well-matched brand deal will gain you a whole new audience, led by a trusted source of information. Influencer marketing can often feel more organic than traditional advertisements and can therefore be a very effective sales driving force in your online marketing strategy. </p>

<p>Social media&nbsp;is&nbsp;a vital tool to a modern business.&nbsp;Never&nbsp;has there been such a perfect way to directly connect with your customers and build your brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now more than ever, it is vital to master your companies’ social media presence to achieve business success. Engaging social media content is essential to maintaining strong customer relationships, reaching new audiences, and establishing what it is that makes your business stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A social media marketing strategy should be at the forefront of any modern business plan. Below are our&nbsp;three&nbsp;top tips to create engaging content that works for&nbsp;you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Promote your socials</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above all else, it is key that your customers are aware your business has social media accounts. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook have millions of users across the globe, and it can be easy for your business to get lost in a crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can make it easier for your customers to find you in a variety of ways.&nbsp;Adding social media links to your company emails, newsletters, and leaflets is an ideal way to remind customers that you have a social media presence and start building up that audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Never underestimate the power of a promoted post too, which can be a great way to reach potential new customers across social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another great way to make&nbsp;your business easy to find&nbsp;on social platforms is&nbsp;by utilising popular hashtags&nbsp;in your industry,&nbsp;or even creating your own, both of&nbsp;which&nbsp;will&nbsp;help you target a new audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li><strong>A picture is worth a thousand words</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be tempting to write paragraphs and paragraphs&nbsp;about yourself&nbsp;when you first&nbsp;set-up&nbsp;social media for your business. It’s&nbsp;exciting to&nbsp;share&nbsp;your businesses mission&nbsp;and it may feel like the more information you give your customers, the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, while it is important to inform customers, you should never overwhelm your audience either. Too much text will never be read and can completely undermine your social media strategy. Images are your best friend when it comes to generating social media engagement, and through a mixture of personalised images, trend-driven graphics, informative infographics, and relevant stories, you will find your posts get far more engagement, while still giving your audience the key facts of your brand.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3"><li><strong>The power of word-of-mouth</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your social media platforms&nbsp;are&nbsp;the perfect place to promote those rave-reviews from your customers. After all, you worked so hard to achieve such good reviews, why not shout them from the roof tops?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An audience is going to trust your business far more if they know other customers have been thrilled with your company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good word of mouth can appear far more organic and trustworthy than traditional advertising. This is also why working with&nbsp;Influencers can be a real benefit to your company. Potential new customers are far more likely to trust your company if someone they&nbsp;know,&nbsp;and trust shares a good opinion about it. Remember to always tag influencers and customers in any good reviews you promote&nbsp;in your social media content, as this will also help drive wider engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color"><strong>Looks can be deceiving, but that&nbsp;doesn’t generally&nbsp;fly with customers when it comes to&nbsp;a business's&nbsp;website&nbsp;– if&nbsp;your site isn’t&nbsp;functioning as it should or looking a little outdated,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;off-putting&nbsp;and&nbsp;could impact your sales or enquires. Whatever your industry or however you trade, your site will always be one of the most important aspects of your business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s vital you show that you’re a trusted and reliable brand; this will impact your potential customers decision to part with their cash and could push them to your competitors if they don’t like what they see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online shopping is rapidly evolving, many of us finding ourselves with more time to scroll and shop online. According to the Internet Retailing report, UK ecommerce sales grew a whopping 168% in May and continue to rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is your website proudly flying the flag for your business? Is your site mobile friendly? Does it take more than 3 seconds to load? These are all questions you should take into consideration when it comes to online marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A user-friendly, clear and informative website goes hand in hand with your digital marketing strategy, so it’s crucial for your website to tick all the boxes or it could very well waste the time and money you’re putting into your SEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so many businesses fighting for a top spot on the likes of Google, it’s crucial that your website stands out from your competitors for all the right reasons!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t sell online? That doesn’t mean these rules don’t apply to you. For most, when thinking about using a company’s services, one of the first things they do is visit your website to get a feel for your business. So, make sure it’s a pleasurable experience or they could well land their business with the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take direct response advertising out of the equation to truly meet the needs of your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve all been there. Busy scrolling through photos of dog antics and giant sandwiches, when&nbsp;all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden&nbsp;you’ve signed up for a free&nbsp;twelve week&nbsp;shred plan and are being bombarded with emails about joining a fitter, stronger community. You might open the first email, curious about the authenticity of said brand’s content, but soon you&nbsp;realise&nbsp;they know nothing about you, or your health goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is exactly why direct response advertising is damaging your social media strategy and doesn’t make good business sense. Fast and hard conversions can become tiring and transparent to the consumer. Everyone wants to feel unique and understood, it’s a basic human instinct. Marketing to the masses in this way can feel intrusive and uncomfortable, and your reputation could be at stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our client journey starts with the client. And funnily enough it ends with the client too. Simultaneously we are cultivating our relationship, and their product awareness. Use this three-step social media strategy to generate real content that speaks to your audience without needlessly&nbsp;capitalising&nbsp;on their data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 1: Plan the route.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to be able to anticipate where you want to lead your consumers. Mapping out their buying process is crucial to small business marketing. Make it as personal and as seamless as possible, and ask yourself: What exactly is it that you want them to do? Interact with your service? Follow you? Buy a product? Recommend a product?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you understand where you are navigating consumers, your delivery can be fit for purpose.&nbsp;Analyse&nbsp;their engagement habits to create the kind of social media content they&nbsp;actually want&nbsp;to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 2: Produce high-quality content.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First think about the social media platform you are&nbsp;utilising. Whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn, a snappy video, current news item, blog post or infographic, can be a great way to get feet through the door. Catchy and informative copywriting, clear visuals and emotional topics can not only drive traffic to your&nbsp;site, but&nbsp;build a true picture of your brand and ethos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Small business marketing relies on relevance.&nbsp;So&nbsp;make sure you are using SEO&nbsp;keywords, and&nbsp;remember where the client is standing. Don’t sell them an automated sprinkler system if they don’t have a garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this is where the next step comes in….&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp;Mobilisation.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its&nbsp;time to see that digital marketing strategy in action. Take&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the users that have engaged with your initial post. You have effectively managed to catch the&nbsp;eye,&nbsp;they are now prospective buyers. The aim is to keep them active by delivering more relevant material. Promote&nbsp;<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/user-generated-content-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user-generated content</a>, images or&nbsp;hashtags, whatever they need to take that next step. This will improve your social media ROI because you are continually influencing consumers beyond their point of entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some may have stumbled across your blog via a friend, or by accident, some may have heard of your products through online reviews, but it takes several touches for the client to be “sales ready”. Six to eight statistically.&nbsp;Optimise&nbsp;your small business strategy, by respecting each touch point as if it were the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, stop flooding feeds with freebies, and start listening to your customers. Free, non-invasive digital marketing at&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;finest.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong>Blogging is hugely beneficial to any business&nbsp;when it comes to online marketing,&nbsp;but&nbsp;particularly small businesses&nbsp;and&nbsp;start-ups; the key reason being – it gives your search engine rankings a major boost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The likes of Google&nbsp;and Bing,&nbsp;LOVE fresh, new content – when blogging consistently, you’re giving&nbsp;those search engines&nbsp;more ammo to index your website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before you get started on your blogging venture,&nbsp;you need to give some thought to your&nbsp;approach.&nbsp;You may already be aware that&nbsp;keywords are good for content,&nbsp;but&nbsp;cramming&nbsp;them in&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;need to be&nbsp;the&nbsp;main aim&nbsp;of your blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask yourself this,&nbsp;is your goal to increase&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;from customers?&nbsp;Or&nbsp;pleasing Google with your&nbsp;keywords?&nbsp;There isn’t a right or wrong answer,&nbsp;and you can find a good balance of both,&nbsp;but if&nbsp;you’re writing a blog&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;useful&nbsp;industry&nbsp;know-how,&nbsp;you don’t need to&nbsp;worry so&nbsp;much&nbsp;about&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;being the&nbsp;main focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great example of this; do you often get asked the same questions by customers?&nbsp;This is a great time to flex&nbsp;that&nbsp;thought leadership,&nbsp;show off your&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;and answer those burning questions from your&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;Your industry&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;will&nbsp;position you as an expert&nbsp;in the field,&nbsp;connecting your customers with your brand and rest assured they’ll keep coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blogs&nbsp;open-up&nbsp;another means of connecting and engaging with your audience,&nbsp;reaping that all-important constructive feedback, giving you a better understanding of what they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are&nbsp;aiming for&nbsp;the alternative of&nbsp;a keyword led blog instead&nbsp;to please those search engines, one thing to bear in mind,&nbsp;ensure your content reads&nbsp;naturally&nbsp;and&nbsp;keywords flow&nbsp;in a sentence, otherwise you could be accused of keyword stuffing&nbsp;– which&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;won’t get you on Google’s good side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are all experts in your field and know your business better than anyone, use your knowledge and experience to your advantage, share your tricks of the trade, establish yourself as an industry leader – build yourself up as the “go-to” for trustworthy and informative content, this will lead to increasing your conversion rates and gaining credibility in the process – win!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget to ask your readers to subscribe to your blog posts, not only is this beneficial for marketing purposes, it’s a great tool for promoting your business –&nbsp;and&nbsp;best of all, it’s totally free marketing, baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last fifteen years, social media has played a huge role in the language of marketing. Fax numbers have been replaced by handles on email signatures, and a quick post to keep clients up to date with company news or share product information, has transformed into a full-time role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consumer&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;has influenced how, when, and why we post, but should we be reporting on our online marketing activity, and how can reports affect long-term digital strategy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stats matter. Each platform is geared specifically to help you develop content to drive traffic and reach your target audience. Twitter Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Instagram Insights track how followers interact with your pages, monitoring clicks and advertisement spending.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scheduling software such as&nbsp;Brandwatch, Buffer and Hootsuite all offer different packages to ensure your digital marketing is performing at its best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the low down on just a few of the reasons why you should&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;social media marketing reports to reap the rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To measure the competition.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know that a tailored approach to your digital strategy is&nbsp;important, but&nbsp;being able to assess your direct competition can affect how you approach your content moving forwards. You can’t fill the gaps in the market, if you don’t know where they are.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To interpret your activity.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clients, stakeholders, and directors,&nbsp;are often looking for bitesize impact reports to validate the influence of social media marketing, and gauge&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;effectiveness. Data gathered can demonstrate growth in engagement and how volume of posts affect your potential reach rate. Reporting on your online activity can determine if your business is meeting&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To understand how your brand is perceived.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media marketing is a great way to network and build relationships with your audience, but it isn’t always the kindest environment to find yourself in. Being accessible 24/7 can leave your brand vulnerable to negative comments or criticism, and monitoring perception be a great way to improve your offering. Tools such as Google Alerts and&nbsp;Rankur&nbsp;can help manage your online reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To update your strategy.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Determining a timeframe for your reports can enable you to have a clear picture of your performance&nbsp;online, and&nbsp;form the basis for future planning. Reporting can look at your conversion rate and illustrate which campaigns have been successful. These are all useful metrics for assessing your social media ROI and help justify budgets allocated to digital marketing.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To promote your business online.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s no longer enough to just have a flashy website and PR message. Strong social media feeds will amplify sales and drive purchase decisions. Report on what is, and what isn’t working, and you’ll be trending in no time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imagine sitting with friends having a drink talking about your business. That tone, that type of language and that level of simplicity should be your goal in promoting your company on the web. This way your content will be more natural, more authentic and easier to read.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is especially true of&nbsp;social media,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a more informal medium than other&nbsp;channels.&nbsp;Your content should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn more about you or your business. So avoid technicalities,&nbsp;being too articulate – Think, light.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Update your content frequently</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do it often. Write as much as possible. This has two advantages:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. You&nbsp;will improve&nbsp;your&nbsp;writing:&nbsp;practice will help you hone your skills and find your voice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;You will keep the attention of your readers -&nbsp;publish on Facebook and&nbsp;Instagram once&nbsp;a day. This&nbsp;will get you in the rhythm and help you practice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all social media posts will be stunning content, but that's okay. See it this way: every post that is not very successful will be a lesson on what not to do&nbsp;– Practice makes perfect, remember?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Add visual elements to your posts</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to keep readers' attention on your content, add photos - but also graphs, tables, videos, GIFs and more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;most popular are&nbsp;videos,&nbsp;especially on Facebook and Instagram. Opt for video in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vertical format to encourage usability on smartphones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same thing goes for your blog content. Not only will readers appreciate that you don't have to scroll through a wall of words, but you will have an additional tool for doing SEO, as search engines scan images and captions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>S</strong><strong>hort posts for engagement, l</strong><strong>ong content for traffic</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about link building for your blog: one of the main reasons why people use social media is to drive traffic to their pages. What kind of content are you writing for your blog? Are they long, short or somewhere in-between?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no precise rules&nbsp;on how long your posts should be. In truth, they should first of all be well&nbsp;written.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, short posts are best for gathering feedback, comments and other types of interactions from readers (people prefer to read short texts, so you are more likely to have their attention if you write less than 300 words). Longer posts (1,000-2,500 words), full of keywords and information, are better for stimulating social sharing and search engine&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, go forth and&nbsp;try your hand at a few social media post – you’ll see it’s a lot easier than you think.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sooner or later, everyone has had this experience: a friend drags us proudly to his computer to show us the new design of his website.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He types in his URL, and we wait uncomfortably for 10 seconds for the home screen to load, pondering the polite response we will give them when they inevitably ask us what we think.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not surprisingly, when another friend tries to visit the site on Google with his smartphone, it is nowhere to be found, and when he uses the exact URL, the page does not display correctly on his device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are all symptoms of classic errors that are the result of a lack of attention to the key factors for SEO: data size, code length efficiency and mobile accessibility. All of these factors can influence SEO in their own way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s have a look at a few quick-fixes to boost your SEO.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Speed up!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The value of speed for usability is clear: having content that loads quickly makes a website more attractive resulting in increased traffic and better conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the case, even more so, for smartphone users who are often on the move. We know that if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, 58% of mobile users will go elsewhere.&nbsp;One of the main ways to keep website loading speeds low is to avoid excessive use of site code and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compression is one of the most popular tactics for increasing site speed. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded, overall latency decreases. The most used compression method is Gzip, which is free and remarkably&nbsp;effective.&nbsp;It has been estimated that 90% of online traffic is through browsers that support Gzip. The procedure works by zipping large files in a smaller format, which can be loaded quickly with the HTTP request. It can reduce site volume by approximately 70%.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speed of the pages also plays an important role in technical SEO, because the speed of the pages makes them easier to find and scan by search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Make your mobile website responsive</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, mobile devices are the primary means by which people access the Internet. About 60% of Google searches are done via&nbsp;mobile.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This makes it a fundamental ranking factor, which allows you to increase your visibility on search engines. In&nbsp;fact;&nbsp;Google has introduced mobile-first indexing to ensure optimal user experience.&nbsp;This means that the mobile version of your website will be indexed before the desktop version.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get the&nbsp;best results in terms of optimisation and visibility, you need&nbsp;to use a responsive design&nbsp;theme,&nbsp;rather than the mobile version separate from your website.&nbsp;One way to check if your website is responsive is to use the Google Mobile test&nbsp;tool,&nbsp;which will show you its ease of use and site structure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Publish quality content</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may seem like a foregone conclusion, but we must not forget that the most important thing for SEO copywriting is to create high quality and well-written content.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not write for search engines, write for your users, offer them useful content and that can intercept the needs expressed in the form of queries in search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not fill your texts with keywords (keyword stuffing); it is important to maintain certain naturalness in writing, without forcing the keys in your content. Find the main keyword; insert it at the beginning, in some paragraphs and at the end, taking care not to repeat it too much.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are&nbsp;just 3&nbsp;quick ways you can make your SEO work better for you and your customers.&nbsp;</p>

"<p>23rd March 2020, the day when lockdown was implemented across the UK and the world copes with life indoors, it seems we’ve battened down the hatches settled in to be at home for the long haul, we have seen the shifts of this “new norm” across many sectors but for most, the financial effects of the world protecting itself from the virus are drastic. For others, business is absolutely booming.</p>
<p>What does this tell us about how people are utilising the web? Well, there is no doubt that many people globally have a lot more time on their hands and the only escape to the outside world is a connection to the internet – People are, more than ever, browsing and clicking, whether it be for personal improvement or home-improvement, or re-aligning business strategies to cope with the impending devastation of the virus, there is no doubt that there has been a sea-change from the high-street to the web.</p>
<p>With this in mind, businesses need to be seen, now more than ever, to be visible and marketable to attract the increased flow of traffic to your site, it’s worth bearing in mind too that a big focus of this new shift should also concentrate on your existing client base, making them aware that you are doing what you can to accommodate their needs by being accessible in a very difficult time.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen so far, is a huge flood of businesses who have coasted along with not much more than a landing page on their website, realising suddenly that footfall is non-existent and therefore needing to improve their visibility online is the only method of survival, whether that be rebranding or building a new website. There have also been many brilliant new business ventures and ideas born out of necessity and struggle, which goes to show that a problem really is the time to do your best.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about improving your visibility and making you seen, and of course, heard – What can you do to market yourself to a new and existing audience?</p>
<p><strong>Content content content!</strong><br />Content marketing strategies will help keep you an on-going relationship during, and even after, the coronavirus pandemic. Content marketing is an effective way for you to keep in touch with your customers and increase business flow during the coronavirus pandemic. Communicating and engaging with your audience with regularly updated content is a great way to promote your activities online.</p>
<p><strong>Are you social?</strong><br />Do you have a social media campaign that engages with your potential customers? If you haven’t started a Facebook, Twitter or Instagram page or you’re not engaging your audience across channels such as these, you’re missing a big opportunity to tap into that all-important click-through, and channel traffic to your business. Beware, however, you don’t want to be tone-deaf and alienate people, because nearly everyone these days is worried about something related to the virus, subtlety is the key.</p>
<p><strong>Email marketing</strong><br />Communicating with clients via emails is not dead – it’s alive and kicking! And, within this strategy, we can find different types of emails, such as mailing and newsletters. A good email can not only become an invaluable way to increase your sales and foster loyalty but also drive web traffic right from the email to your content or products.</p>
<p>With just a few small tweaks in your marketing strategy, you should see an uptick in traffic and engagement – give it go.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
"<strong>1. Refine your keyword research</strong>
To generate ideas you can use the tools made available by Google, such as Google Suggest and Google related searches, in addition to the keyword planner. Related research may suggest topics for future discussion. Google Keyword Planner allows you to find a lot of information on the keywords we insert, including suggestions, long-tail keywords and more. In this way, it will be possible to track users' search trends and set their content based on these.

<strong>2. Use Reddit and Social Media</strong>
Reddit is divided into many channels or Sub-reddits and there are thousands of them. Just search the main page to start finding something interesting. Similarly, search on Facebook, Twitter and other minor social media. Tools like BuzzSumo, in this case, are a real godsend. Yahoo Answers is another source, along with blogs and industry forums.

<strong>3. Take advantage of user comments</strong>
Users who read your posts have opinions about it. The ideas expressed in the articles can be used as inspiration to writing a new article. Collecting the most interesting comments and building a blog post around that will ensure a quick-win for you in terms of ideas, but also show your audience that you’re engaging with them.
Consulting the places on the web where possible visitors to the company blog find themselves can be very useful for discovering hot topics, central themes, and current trends. Knowing what the target users are asking themselves is the key to writing content that fits perfectly because they contain exactly the answer they are looking for. Thematic groups on Facebook, the forums on sites in the sector of relevance should not be overlooked.

<strong>4. Organise everything with the Mind Map</strong>
Mind maps are decisive for organising the work done with keyword research. How do they work? Put the fundamental theme of the blog at the centre of the graph. Then, based on the results obtained from the searches, enter more specific categories and themes. Soon, you’ll have a wonderland of ideas that stem from just one central idea or search. Use simple and effective tools like Freemind, Mindmup and Coogle. I always recommend the latter solution, free and integrated with Google Drive. Finding ideas for a blog means organising the topic.

<strong>5. Tell us how you live</strong>
Tell us what happens every day around you. Put concrete experiences, successes and losses on digital paper. Thinking about a simple starting point for a detached or non-contextualised article can be a problem. You are your blog and putting your experience in the foreground is an obligation. Make it personal and add your own experiences to the mix – it’s all about being relatable.

<strong>6. Answer private questions</strong>
Readers often ask questions privately, on Messenger or via email. What do you do? I propose this: Why not answer the question through a blog post; obviously without mentioning the person who left the question, for obvious privacy issues. But in this way you’ve developed two positive aspects to blog posting: on the one hand, you identified a new title for your blog; on the other, you gained the trust of a reader.

<strong>7 - Analyse your searches</strong>
By analysing the search terms of readers who have landed on your blog, you can not only find out what are the most searched topics and therefore to deepen or re-propose in a new perspective, but you can also find ideas for new topics that you have not yet covered and that users expect to find on your blog. This will also help you shape your digital marketing campaign in the right direction.

<strong>8. Use Buzzsumo</strong>
This is a very simple and free web marketing tool to use to find new ideas that give interesting results: just type in the search keywords on the topic you want to write on and the program will return you the most shared articles on social networks related to the topic. There are many more free and paid-for online marketing tools such as Buzzsumo.
Reading them can inspire you to write something on the same theme. In the free version, Buzzsumo returns only 10 results for each word entered, but various searches may be more than enough to find a new idea to write your next content on the blog.

<strong>9. Be inspired by the pictures</strong>
Find inspiration in images - Sometimes words say more than a thousand images, but the opposite is also true. The widespread use of image-focused social networks has become an extraordinary source of inspiration.
Image-based social networks offer two very useful tools for finding interesting images that can stimulate imagination and creativity: Instagram and Pinterest. Use the internal search engines of the two applications to find new topics to write about.
A picture is worth a thousand words.

<strong>10. Do an interview</strong>
An excellent idea for new content is to do an interview, perhaps with an expert in your sector, with a colleague or to someone who can offer interesting feedback on a certain topic.
Interviews are also a very useful way, not only to have new content but also to increase our traffic and our visibility since the interview will almost certainly be shared again by the person who was interviewed."
"<strong>70-80% of searchers focus on Organic search results(SEO) over paid Ad results - .</strong>

More traffic means more sales. Optimising the individual product pages on your ecommerce site is one of the most effective ways to improve the traffic to your site. This blog aims to give you tips and tricks to help your business succeed.

The name of a product is the biggest influence on organic search rankings. The product name is typically in the title, heading tags and other related metadata. Highly descriptive product names are clear for both consumers and the search engine algorithms. Product names are usually set in stone, but modifying the information in the title is a great way to differentiate between similar products so customers can find exactly what they’re looking for.

<strong>Don’t just cut and paste the product names used on Amazon or your competitors – add a little extra thought.</strong>

Add extensive product descriptions. You can list options including colour, size, material, style along with any other attributes or features that may improve contextual search relevance and help shoppers. Shoppers will have landed directly from a search engine, which means they may be unfamiliar with your site. Make sure you make everything easy to use so they don’t bounce back to search results. Use highlights and bullet points.

<strong>Each product page is its own advert so treat it like it was going to appear on a road side billboard – now will your customers still like what they see?</strong>

User generated content is an SEO goldmine, underutilised by many ecommerce websites. User generated content such as reviews can boost contextual relevance by using the language of the reviews to change and alter the language in your description, which can boost SEO rankings. Implemented correctly, these reviews can be considered part of the site’s content. However, if done wrong or these reviews are filled with spam, it can muddle the relevancy and even have a negative impact on your site’s ranking. In order to avoid this, it is vital reviews are moderated and maybe even pin the most helpful comments to the top of the list. There are so many partner review sites out there, <a href="http://www.trustpilot.com">www.trustpliot.com</a>. <a href="http://www.reviews.co.uk">www.reviews.co.uk</a> or just add a genuine one yourself.

Using the usual SEO tips and tricks are great, but ecommerce sites have a lot of options that many don’t even think to take advantage of. Take your business to the next level by improving your SEO ranking and making it easier for consumers to find you. Your e-commerce package will have a section on SEO best practises that are optimised for the way it works. Please take time to read and understand what they recommend and do it! These are big companies with big research budgets, they earn more when you earn more ie when you get more traffic."
"Social media is always changing the way we communicate with each other, how we interact with brands and how we consume information. Successful content marketers are effectively utilising all social media platforms and delivering high-quality content consistently.

<strong>It’s unlikely to come as a shock to anyone that visual content is up to forty times more likely to be shared than all text content. One major aspect of this is video and around 65% of SMEs and larger operations considering it the most engaging communication channel for their audiences.</strong>

With online video predicted to be making up over 80% of all consumer traffic by 2022, the real question is, are you making the most of your social media presence with video? This blog aims to give you reasons why you need to use video on your social media platforms.

Video is incredibly easy to consume. Unlike large chunks of text which are easy to scroll past, even when passively scrolling, video attracts attention and captures your audience’s interest. It’s vital that you find a balance, making the videos long enough to get across your information but short enough to keep people wanting more. Make sure your intention is clear at the beginning of the video before people have a chance to scroll away. If in doubt – then go short.

All of your content should be optimised for SEO and videos are no exception. Ensure your content is relevant and that your captions and descriptions are compelling, so they register in the right searches. Each social media platform has different tools to help you reach your audience so be sure to utilise them.

It’s crucial to have a goal in mind before you post. Whether you want people to visit your site and drive up traffic, share the video or purchase your product, it’s important to include a call to action.

Make the most of relevant and trending topics. Video allows your brand to move quickly and smart brands will use this fast pace to become part of the conversation. You can also plan ahead. Certain hashtags trend every week (#MondayMotivation, for example) and span across a range of demographics. Use these to your advantage and be prepared to make your brand spark conversations.

There are free video tools out there. Try them. Do one or two just to test, then show your friends, get feedback and then starting posting them. They do not have to be perfect, they just have to be real."
"SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) will boost your website’s rank in search engines, build brand recognition and ensure your business looks more trustworthy to potential customers. This blog aims to help you understand exactly what SEO is and how to make it work to the benefit of your business.

SEO helps all businesses but it’s especially vital for small and medium enterprises:
<ul>
 	<li>Build an effective web presence</li>
 	<li>Bypass your competitors to get more customers</li>
 	<li>Take your firm to the next level.</li>
</ul>
A good SEO strategy can ensure your website is one of the first results your customers see. Not only does this make it more likely to be seen but it also increases the trust that customers have in your brand as results on the first couple of pages are seen as more user friendly and reliable.

As well as helping customers find you, SEO can help make your brand more recognisable. The more people see or visit your website, the more they’ll remember it. When they need what you offer, why would they go anywhere else? This means google will think it a better site and rank you even higher.

There are other businesses doing what you do. Set yourself apart with an effective SEO strategy that allows you to spend less time trying to appeal to potential customers and focus on making your business great.

Whether you’re just starting out or you’re looking to take your SME to the next level, SEO is vital and something you should definitely not overlook.

Is SEO expensive? For small local or niche businesses it does not need to be, there are plans out there for £129 per month, no commitment and includes a good analysis of your needs in the first month. How much is one, five ten new customers a month worth?"
"Marketing is an industry with a history probably going back to Roman times. The aim of the game has always been that you, your company or product stand out. However, as most industries become increasingly crowded and competitive, it’s vital work harder at doing the stand out with a good digital presence.

Digital marketing is so important:
<ul>
 	<li>It’s cost effective</li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Guarantees a higher conversion rate</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Opens your business up for growth</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Connects with a mobile audience</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Increases the trust in your brand</span></li>
</ul>
However, to reap the benefits, you need an effective digital marketing strategy. This blog aims to give you the advice you need to make a successful digital plan turn into a true strategy.

Firstly, it’s important to ensure your site is mobile friendly and generally easy to use on all devices.

<strong>In 2019, over half of all internet traffic came from mobile phone users and, according to google, 63% of searches were made using a phone or other mobile device. Google will start to ignore your site if it performs poorly on mobile devices.</strong>

Keep updating your site with a fresh, modern look with all the information a potential customer could need easy to find.

Thinking globally is great but take east advantage of more local opportunities. You may be surprised how many potential customers are searching for what you’re selling. Add your details to listings in your local search directories so local customers find you first – most are free.

Complacency is the enemy of success when it comes to digital marketing. When drafting your initial strategy, be certain that you’re willing to evaluate the outcomes and follow up on new marketing trends in order to improve where necessary. Put aside a couple of hours every month to review what you are doing.

Follow the digital marketing rule of three:
<ul>
 	<li>Keep it simple</li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Be consistent</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: inherit;">Always respond to feedback (both good and bad) immediately</span></li>
</ul>
Social media is a fantastic marketing tool, but it’s important to add a personal touch too. Many businesses blast their followers with promotional content without considering how to effectively target their customer demographic and build a community. Research suggests that people respond much more positively to companies that offer valuable content and work to connect with their followers rather than using their social media platforms as a billboard.

<strong>Social media reviews influence almost 70% of consumers. It’s time to use that to your advantage! Encourage existing clients to leave you reviews and try to maintain a rating of over four stars.</strong>

No matter people’s age, profession or purchase preference, almost everyone checks their email on a daily basis. Create a regular newsletter or simple emails with deals, offers and discounts to interact with your target community regularly. But, remember, GDPR is still out there, don’t spam."
"With almost 43 million Brits using social media regularly, businesses are missing out on a huge potential advertising platform by not utilising these free platforms.

It’s an ideal way to connect with people who already love your brand and introduce it to those yet to discover it. This blog aims to give you social media tips that can help you build your brand, reach new markets and, ultimately, increase revenue.

Posting is easy but it’s wise to start with a plan. Figure out exactly what you’re looking to achieve and ensure your social media posts and efforts support you in meeting your goals. Ensure you follow smart guidelines; posts should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. It’s also important to make sure your aims are actually right for your business. Focus on increasing sales rather than likes (though giving your followers list a boost will help in making your business look legit). Observe what your competitors are doing and learn from their successes and their mistakes. You want to keep your presence unique but it’s just smart to see what’s working and what isn’t and reduce your own learning curve. In addition to looking at your competitors, take inspiration from businesses and industries different from yours.

If you’re already using social media, time to evaluate its effectiveness. Perform an audit and take a good look at your analytics to see if you’re reaching the audience you’re looking to. It also helps to have a social media calendar in place so you can keep track of when to post and check your platform stats and insights for optimal time to post and engage.

Establish who you’re looking to reach with your posts. Finding your target audience is vital for any business and doing so allows you to determine which platform is right for your business. That doesn’t mean you need to limit yourself to one. This allows you to know how to distribute your social media resources most effectively. Once you know how your audience responds, it will be easier to expand your audience.

Responding and reacting to relevant comments is a great way to use social media as a business. Whether that’s responding to criticism or praise, letting your customers know you care and are listening to their concerns is an effective way to build trust and guide the narrative around your business.

You can also schedule your posts to free up your time for engagement, there is various online software out there to help with this such as Hootsuite. Once you’ve established what posts do well on which platform and at what time, you can spend a small amount of time creating all of your social media posts and using scheduling tools and programs to post them automatically at the right time."
"When creating an Ecommerce business, you need your customers to do an awful lot for you. You need them to put trust in you that your products are good enough to buy and your website is secure enough to trust with their sensitive and valuable information to purchase from you and come back and spend more money there in the future.

So, the least you can do for them is make your website user-friendly and put yourself in the position to get the highest number of conversions possible.

Customer care and satisfaction is vital to the success of any business and there should be clear opportunities on your website for your customers to engage with you in person through email, telephone or online live chat. Utilise social media for this purpose too.

Make sure the homepage loads quickly. The ideal load time is 2 seconds or less. If shoppers have to wait or the site isn’t optimised for their mobile devices, they may well leave without seeing what you have to offer. Streamline your design by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load the various components, which will speed up the load time. This can also be achieved by compressing pages to reduce the bandwidth. There are other ways to do this too so if load time is a problem, it might be worth contacting the professionals.

Update your homepage regularly. Seeing Christmas stock midway through March is one of the quickest ways to turn customers off your products.

Make sure the navigation is easy to use and users don’t have to go through tons of pages to get where they want to be. The right number is around three clicks maximum.

Have all the information a consumer might need on your product page. This includes sizing information, detailed product description, shipping details and a returns policy as well as different views of the item and colour selections included.

Make the call to action obvious. A big, bold ‘buy now’ button is ideal! After that, ensure the checkout process as easy as possible to reduce cart abandonment. Completing a transaction should be a simple, smooth process.

Security is important to prevent your clients from getting nervous about the trustworthiness of your site. Be certain it’s completely secure and all updates are installed regularly."
"We're all feeling the effects of Covid-19 and concerned for what the future holds, particularly small business owners.

On the brighter side of things, online marketing is still an effective tool for your business - maybe now more than ever.

Have you shut up shop? Closed the doors to self-isolate? Committed to the hermit life?

There's no need to distance yourself from the online world, more people are logged on and scrolling than ever right now and it's as good an opportunity as any to spread the word about your business, put out some positivity and most importantly - connect and engage with your audience.

Don't lockdown and allow people to forget about you, not only will you lose momentum with all that fabulous content you're posting, but you'll likely lose followers too.

Your customer base is still there and very much listening, so keep on popping up in people's newsfeeds and connecting with your followers - even if you aren’t open for business right now (but hiding under a duvet with the dog and your laptop), make yourself known! Whether it’s recycling old content, posting a good ol' throwback or spreading some love - it’s a great time for connecting and engaging.

Stay safe, stay visible online - whatever your business!"
"SaleCycle Ecommerce’s stat report revealed that three quarters of shoppers abandon their carts before checking out. That’s over three quarters of sales being missed! That’s a huge amount of revenue that your business could be benefitting from. This blog aims to help you understand why carts are being abandoned and, most importantly, start reducing the number of your clients that don’t follow through on their purchases.

There will always be some level of abandonment. We’ve all had a quick browse to kill some time, added things to our cart and then decide to close the browser and get on with something else. However, there are reasons that people intending to make a purchase decide they don’t want to complete it.

One reason is having to sign up and create an account. Accounts can be really useful, but having to set one up, think of a password and verify your account via email is a hassle! Offering a guest checkout option allows people the choice and gets them through the process quicker.

A major factor in not following through is concerns about security. If a site doesn’t have an SSL certificate or just seems like it doesn’t have the best protections in place for sensitive data like credit card information, consumers are unlikely to want to share that information and potentially put themselves at risk.

If there are hidden fees like taxes or shipping rates that are higher than expected, people are likely to decide they’re not interested in paying more than they expected! Plus, if shipping takes a long time, many consumers decide they’re not willing to wait that long for their product. Making returns difficult also turns customers off the idea of buying from you. People want to feel supported and assisted when shopping in person or online.

Now you know the major problems, you can work on fixing them. Ensure your site is secure and has an SSL certificate so people know they can trust you with their payment details. You should also make your shipping prices as transparent as possible and automatically apply tax to your products.

You can also add an extra level of trust by filling your site with reviews, endorsements and your full contact information.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, the nature of the Ecommerce cycle means there will always be some shopping cart abandonment. This means it’s important to recover as many of these sales as possible.

Some people will automatically come back after having had some time to think. Others need a little bit of prompting. You can try to entice them with a good email turning the failed transaction into a way to showcase your customer service skills and maybe even get a conversion."
"For small and medium enterprises, it can feel disheartening when a website doesn’t immediately start bringing in customers. However, websites don’t promote themselves and with more than 1.5 billion websites on the internet, which means making your site stand out might take some professional expertise.

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is essentially a continuing marketing process for your website, which ensures it’s attractive to the search engines and therefore getting it noticed by potential customers. Once you’ve implemented SEO strategies onto your site, they can be taken even further, to help make sure site visitors are converted into customers.

Whether you’re a welder in Wakefield or a kennel owner in Kirkintilloch, you need to get your website to the top of the search results of that type of business in your area.

SEO utilises a range of on-page and off-page tools and strategies to maximise visits to your site and conversions once people are there. These tactics allow your site to be viewed favourable by search engines. From high quality content to relevant keywords, you need to utilise all the tools are your disposal.

Though often the most well-known, increased business and sales aren’t the only benefits to a good SEO strategy.

Other benefits include saving on advertising costs. By ensuring your site makes it to the top of search engine results, you don’t need to worry too much about advertising. Your customers will be able to find you easily. You also get to measure your success. When you invest in SEO work, you can see your analytics and find out what’s working and, more importantly, what isn’t. This means you don’t need to waste time, money and resources on things that don’t benefit your business.

On top of that, when your site is ranked highly on the Google results page, it instantly increases the trust of potential clients and makes you look more credible.

Furthermore, a high SEO rank will increase your brand awareness making your business more familiar to any potential customers, so even if they don’t need you right away, they’ll be able to find you when they do. Ranking highly also increases the value of your business.

If you don’t invest in SEO strategy, you’re behind the competitors that do. These tools allow SMEs to compete with even the largest companies in their sector. You’re good at what you do and potential customers should be able to find you."
"LinkedIn is an incredibly valuable tool to grow your business and it can help you connect with market leaders in your field. It’s absolutely vital to utilise this free tool in a way that allows your business to grow and thrive.

To take full advantage of LinkedIn, you need to connect with people, interact with people and build a great profile.

Connecting with people is as simple as it sounds. Set your profile to public and connect with friends, former colleagues, current workmates, those with work that has inspired you, people working at a company you’d love to work at or work with. There’s no limit to the number of people you can connect with and it’s a useful tool for building employment opportunities.

It’s not enough just to connect. Thoughtfully engage with people’s content, talk to people and start conversations. Don’t spam people and ensure you’ve read their posts carefully before commenting, but don’t be scared to make yourself known. If people comment on your posts, comment back. Also, be sure to join and actively participate in groups relevant to your business.

Build a profile that reflects you well. Fill out all the fields that apply to you and your business and ensure there’s a jargon free introduction to you, your business and what you do. Make sure all pictures are of a high quality, professional and fit the dimensions perfectly. You can even link to your own website to give even more details.

LinkedIn is the only social media network that allows you to publish articles. You can create content that is unique to LinkedIn and utilise their analytics so you can see which articles perform the best.

When people search for your business, you want to ensure that the information out there is from you. Of course, you want to direct most people to your own site but it’s vital that you claim all the social media profiles in your name that you can. This allows you to control the narrative about your own business.

LinkedIn users have buying power. 44% of users earn more than £58,000 a year, which means if you have something to sell, someone on LinkedIn has the power to buy. A huge number of LinkedIn users (around 40 million) are in decision-making positions. This means they have the authority to hire your agency, license your software or make a company-wide order of your product.

The recruitment capability of LinkedIn is often underrated. There are premium subscription services that allows you to post job openings, use advanced search options to find the right candidate for you and save you thousands in recruiter fees.

Even if you don’t want to spend a lot of time using LinkedIn, it’s a great tool for your business with opportunities it is well worth exploring."
"Larger-scale companies have been slowly incorporating live chat onto their websites for the past few years. Is it worth it for SMEs? Well, over half of consumers report preferring live chat to phone customer service as it’s instant.

Only around 10% of websites use live chat, which means it could be a great tool for businesses looking to get ahead of their competition. Plus, as it’s most often used by larger companies, it can add real level of professionalism to your site that your competitors just aren’t matching.

As the answers are instantaneous, live chat has been proven to lead to more leads. Studies have shown that potential customers that use live chats are three times more likely to make a purchase. This indicates that those with an online shop specifically could benefit.
Live chats are a way to proactively communicate with clients. This means if they have any concerns or queries, they don’t have to wait on hold or figure out how to connect with you via email. They are greeted with a friendly message that can help ease their worries and answer any questions they have. This allows you to build a relationship with potential clients. People are understandably wary of buying or engaging services from people they don’t know. By providing help when they need it, you can show your clients you’re a firm they can trust.

Typically, support agents can handle three live chats at a time. This means in the same amount of time live chat can offer support to three times as many customers as phone-based customer service. It can offer a quicker interaction and communication that is quicker, easier and more effective. This means no matter the size of your business, it’s easy to keep your clients happy and resolve any problems quickly. This can improve customer satisfaction rates and help your business thrive.

This instant feedback not only helps your clients, it helps you too. It allows you to discover any website issues quickly thanks to customer feedback. This feedback will also allow you to improve your practices by utilising live chat archives to actively search for problems.

So, is live chat a useful tool for your business? If you’re looking to increase sales and engagement while building trust with your potential clients, it’s invaluable."
"<strong>The security, or lack thereof, of a website can have devastating effects on every aspect of your website, including your site’s organic performance. This is why website security is such a vital aspect of marketing plans and shouldn’t just be ignored or left at the bottom of your IT team’s pile.</strong>

So, what exactly is hacking? Hacking is when someone gains access to a website or a network without permission. This is most often done to try and access sensitive information such as credit and debit card details or to redirect traffic to a specific website. The common tools used are malware and spamming. Malware is most often used by hackers looking to create a data breach as it damages or disables a specific network. This can have long-lasting and long-reaching effects on your business and result in huge financial losses for your company as well as a loss in trust that is incredible difficult to get back.

Website spamming, on the other hand, adds hypertext to a webpage that will link to the hacker’s chosen destination when clicked on by a user. This attempts to fast track ethical SEO work by increasing search engine rankings by increasing linked traffic to their own site.

<strong>What Are the Effects of Hacking?</strong>

A study conducted by GoDaddy found that almost three quarters of hacked websites were hacked in order to spam for SEO reasons. In most cases, legitimate websites are turned into link farms where customers are tricked with malware or phishing links.

Malicious code can be devastating for your website. If detected by Google, it will warn users to steer clear of your site and potentially even remove your site from search engines to safeguard their users. This will, of course, have an effect on your SEO value. Overall visits will drop significantly, metrics such as pages per session, will be reduced and users will grow to distrust your business if your site has had security issues, which will affect your rankings and, ultimately, your bottom line.

If there are redirects, they often lead users to phishing sites or malicious content. When this is observed by Google, it hurts your organic SEO ranking and hacking can lead to being blacklisted and further penalised by search engines.

It’s vital your website is protected. Make sure you research any plugins before installing them to ensure they’re safe and well-reviewed. Once you have installed them, always make sure they’re updated. Use strong passwords for all online accounts and consider using your own server, if possible.

Web security is as much a marketing issue as it is an IT one. Protect your SEO rankings by making everything as secure as possible so your business can truly thrive."
"Each website is different, and each business has different goals they’re looking to achieve. It will take a bit of tweaking and general maintenance to have a site that is consistently bringing great results. However, this blog aims to point out a few of the issues that are regularly found in website audits.

Whether you’re creating a new site or you’re looking to work on your current situation where maintenance has perhaps taken a backseat to getting fresh content out there, these issues can affect your site in multiple ways. Some mistakes can cause havoc to your SEO and some will make your site slower therefore more difficult to navigate. Either issue means that you’ll have fewer sales and lost customers. It’s recommended a site audit is performed every six months so that you can identify and rectify any issues.

Ensure you are using your keywords effectively. Don’t overstuff them into very short pieces of content as they should make up around 2% of your content. Make sure you use them in your title tags and alt-tags on images.

It’s important that your site is easy to navigate, and your customers can find what they need in as few clicks as possible. Remove deep pages and broken links in order to improve the user experience. 88% of users report they would be unlikely to return to a site if they had a poor experience on a website. That’s a lot of potential customers lost!

Make sure your site is up to speed by enabling compression for your java and CSS files hosted on external sites. You should also remove unnecessary lines, white-space and comments from your source code to fix unminify JavaScript and CSS.

These tips aren’t a complete fix to your website issues and it’s important to maintain every aspect of your site to ensure you’re reaching as many people as possible. However, this blog should help you solve obvious issues that are having a negative impact on your SEO and the experience of your customers."
"Building a website is just the first step for a small business’ online presence. To ensure your website is truly effective, you have to make sure it gets plenty of TLC. If you want your business to evolve and grow with your customers, it’s vital to be sure it’s working at its ideal level. Don’t panic! This doesn’t mean a big, expensive overhaul to your site. It’s the small changes that often make the biggest difference.

<strong>Ensure your Navigation is as Simple as Possible</strong>

When new and potential customers come to your site, they want to find what they need in as few clicks as possible. This means your navigation needs to be clear, concise and easy to understand.

Your navigation should include 5-7 top-level categories that reflect the content on each subsequent page.

<strong>Put Keywords in your Headings</strong>

Including headings not only makes your content easier to read and nicer to look at, using keywords in them can help your SEO too.

<strong>Add a Call to Action</strong>

Identify any opportunity on your site to add an targeted call to action that aligns with your marketing and sales goals.

As the name suggests, a call to action prompts potential clients to do something. Whether that’s calling your business, booking a free demo, signing up to a newsletter or anything in between, it establishes a connection that you could convert into a sale.

<strong>Rewrite a Page of Content</strong>

Look through your existing content and try to see it from a potential client’s point of view. Is there anything missing? Does it tell them everything they need to know, and does it flow together? If not, rewrite it so it’s relevant and interesting to your audience.

<strong>Add New Images</strong>

This is a fantastic way to freshen up the look of your site. You can also use alt-tags to incorporate keywords into your page.

<strong>Update Your Meta Descriptions</strong>

These are the 160 characters of content that appears on your search engine result directly below your page title. Look at the way your competitors utilise their meta descriptions, see what they do well and what they can improve and use that for your own work.

<strong>Add Testimonials</strong>

Let people see how good your business is. Testimonials add credibility and encourage customers to make a purchase. Whether you want a full page or have them in other areas of the site, it’s a great way to build your brand.

<strong>Identify and Fix Broken Links</strong>

Unfortunately, broken links sometimes happen but they don’t look good and make your website look under-cared for. Click around and ensure everything on your site is connected and working as it should. If not, get it fixed as soon as possible!"
"Globalisation has had an undeniable impact of businesses and supply chains, but local customers are still vital to any business. This blog aims to help you understand just what local SEO is and how you and your business can benefit.

As you might gather from the name, local SEO allows your business to target customers in a specific region. For small/medium enterprises in any sector, this ability is crucial. Google is increasingly ranking local businesses higher in the search results. It makes sense, if you’re a barber in Glasgow, you’re going to have very little custom from people in Southend, no matter how fantastic your fade. So, if someone types in “barbers near me” that’s what they’re looking for. A local business, it’s important to tailor your local SEO to ensure your business shows up.

Even if you have multiple locations, you can still utilise local SEO, but it will take a little bit more work. Use the tools provided by search engines, like Google My Business.

As a small business, you probably already use customer testimonials. They’re an effective, easy way to gain credibility for your site and show off your skills. Why not use these in a way that feature the location you’re trying to target? Keep them current and you’ll benefit from local SEO and get the usual gains from traditional testimonials.

Keeping your data current and consistent. If anything is incomplete or inconsistent, there could be penalties from search engines that negatively affect your SEO. Other aspects of local citations, such as an email address and your business hours, give customers extra confidence in your authority in the local area. If your details change, make updating them on your site and social media platforms a priority.

Ensure your site is optimised for Geo-targeting. If there’s not much to excite local people looking for nearby products and services, it’s unlikely google will take interest either. Find a subtle balance that lets people know you’re nearby without sounding spammy."
"As a small business, you might think that the time and effort that goes into writing blogs just can’t be worth it. However, the benefits can be astronomical and blogs might not be as much effort as you think.

One major boost is to your search engine optimisation. Search engines love fresh, new content and consistent blogging means you give google and other search engines new stuff to index as well as creating new opportunities to plug in those all-important keywords, which helps improve your SEO. You will also benefit from backlinks as other websites begin to link to the articles on your website. This adds more fuel to the SEO fire because search engines consider backlinks as an endorsement of the authority of your website.

Another incredible benefit is the fact you can create great, personal connections with your clients. You can open comments and allow people to have an input on what you’ve written and start conversations that will help you build a rapport, build trust and help you understand exactly what your customer base wants. It can also help connect customers to your brand. It’s important your blog has an overarching sense of your corporate standards while still showing a slightly more human side to the company.

By utilising your knowledge and spreading some lesser known tricks of the trade, you can establish yourself as an industry leader. By becoming a “go to” for reliable, informative content, you can increase your conversion rates as well as gain the credibility needed to compete with larger businesses.

This information will also be a fantastic way to advertise to your customers without being an in your face ad. By offering solutions to their problems, which might include your products, you’re making their lives easier and better. This can lead to building a loyal base that is appreciative of you giving vital, beneficial information out for free.

By asking readers to subscribe to your posts, you can leverage your blog to get emails from interested leads. These emails can be used for marketing purposes to increase touch points and open the door for email marketing opportunities to promote your business, send special promotions, and much, much more. The more often you can connect with a lead, the better your chance of converting them into customers.

Your blog offers so much opportunity for sharing. Whether they link the post, tweet it or anything else, it’s free marketing that shows you to be a credible business."
"No matter what a business does, the most important thing, in terms of marketing success, to determine is your target audience. This allows you to find the most appropriate and effective strategy, tailored to your desired demographic through content, SEO, web design and social media.

According to research, people are drawn to marketing that is personable and more human. Despite all of this, many marketers will barrel ahead with a strategy that guesses what their target market wants rather than actually listening to them, which can lead to ineffective, uninformed methods that can lose you time, money and customers.

So how do you effectively listen to your customer base? This blog aims to guide you through some ideas that can help you find the best strategy for you and your firm.

<strong>Ask Them</strong>

Yes, this is a very direct way of doing it, but surveys are a great way for your audience to tell you just what they want from you. Ensure the survey helps you determine what you audience are looking for, what their challenges are and what they look for in companies that do what you do. These are great for both existing customers and prospective clients as it will allow you to improve your services in line with their expectations and help your retention rates.

<strong>Take a Look at your Analytics</strong>

Looking through your web traffic and social media data can give you an insight into who your audience is, what they’re looking for and help you increase conversions.

Use this data to see where engagement is strongest, where it drops and use this information to direct all of your marketing activities.

<strong>Read the Room</strong>

Social listening is a great marketing tool that allows businesses to see how they rank against their competitors and the general mood towards their company.

People use social media to vent or praise companies and it’s vital that you know what people think of your business whether positive or negative. This allows you to correct your course and adapt your marketing strategies from there.

It’s important to keep up to date with how audiences react and make them feel heard."
"Social media is a key tenant of marketing activity no matter your business. However, there are so many different approaches and results can vary wildly! There’s no exact science but this blog aims to bring you some important guidelines that can help you find the right balance.

One thing you need to consider is who your audience are and when they’re going to be online. It all depends on your business and what you’re offering but, for example, advertising business strategy services on a Friday evening when people are trying to wind down, might not be as effective as you would hope.

You also need to consider how frequently you post. There are many guides out there for various platforms, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, we recommend at least once a day – over posting can have a negative effect on your online presence and people are inclined to unfollow you if you over post. But don’t feel restrained by it, post as you see fit for your business and bear in mind ‘the rules’. Just ensure you’re not posting so often that it feels spammy or so little that you struggle to gain new followers or engage your current ones. It can be tricky to find this balance so be sure to keep track of your analytics and see what is and isn’t effective.

The most vital aspect of your social media posting is making sure you post what’s valuable. Don’t get bogged down with the idea you must post a certain number of times a day even if that means tweeting something completely inane that could irritate your customer base.

Before you post anything on any social media platform, ask yourself: is this relevant to my target audience? Is it consistent the values and objectives of my brand? Is it authentic? If the answer to all three of these questions is ‘yes’, you can be sure you have content that is worth posting."
"Experts estimate that by 2028, 50% of all retail sales will happen online. This means it is more vital than ever to ensure your website is attracting your potential customers, achieving sales and retaining long-term, loyal fans of your brand. If your site is currently more of a brochure, it might be worth starting to increase your e-commerce abilities sooner rather than later in order to stay one step ahead of your competitors.

The most crucial part of your website is the usability factor. It is all well and good having a beautifully designed site, but if it is difficult to use or navigate, your clients won’t hang around for long. Help them find exactly what they need in the fewest clicks possible.

In addition to this, if you’re having a big sale or you have good reason to expect a big influx of traffic, ensure that your servers are up to the job. If there is a crash, it will have a hugely negative impact on your sales and customers are unlikely to return.

We are all more aware than ever of security risks we face when shopping online. Not only is it important to protect your customer’s data for their financial wellbeing, it’s necessary for yours too. Under GDPR, if a business suffers from an attack and their cyber security is found lacking by an investigation, they could face hefty fines. Protect yourself and keep the trust of your customers by staying on top of cyber security.

We all know that your products should be of good quality, but did you know your website needs to be too? Ensure your content is well written, your images are high quality and your site provides a seamless experience.

With all the best intentions, your site isn’t going to be perfect straight away. It’s important to track activity on your site through analytics data. If there is evidence that many potential customers are falling off at a certain point, you can see where the problems may lie. You can also see if the people finding your site are the demographic you’re aiming for and alter any content accordingly."
"Almost every company seems to have a blog these days but very few are actually utilising their blogs in a way that maximises SEO results and getting all the benefits they could be. This blog aims to give you eight easy ways to improve your visibility, traffic and business.

<strong>Create a Great Name</strong>

Work your creative magic; something many businesses miss out, which reduces the optimisation opportunities available to you.

Ask yourself who you’re looking to reach with your blog content, if you can add any important SEO keywords to the title or the content and what the overarching theme of your blog is.

Finding a descriptive name that makes sense for your business can increase organic, incremental traffic. If you can’t think of anything (maybe like a play on words) add keywords to your blog title to make sure people actually see it.

<strong>Reach out to a Specific Audience with Each Post</strong>

You don’t have to reach out to the same segment of your target audience with each blog. In fact, it might be better to vary exactly who you’re aiming your content towards. Create content that is optimised for specific customers and uses keywords and phrases that will reach them.

<strong>Make Sure your URL Structure is Effective</strong>

Ensuring your URL naming convention is effective can be useful for both marketers and visitors for a number of reasons.

Firstly, it makes it easier to track how successful your blogs are through analytics. Including ‘blog’ in your URL structure is an incredibly simple way to report your results and change your content accordingly.

It can also help make your site more user friendly and far more accessible. Make it quick, snappy and leave out words like “and,” “or,” and “but.”

<strong>Continually Optimise Blog Content</strong>

Improving your SEO doesn’t always mean fresh, new content. You can review your current content and look for opportunities to add internal links, optimise current images or add some optimised images, link one post to another related post as well as review title tags and meta descriptions to ensure targeted keywords are included. Performing these tasks rather than adding new content can save you time, money and resource.
Find and Fill Content Gaps

If you’re struggling to rank for high priority keywords because your site hasn’t been able to incorporate them, utilising your blog to write about these keywords could massively help.

<strong>Add Optimised Videos and Images</strong>

Not only do images and videos create a positive experience and increase viewer engagement, but they also have incredible SEO potential too! With your photos, make sure you’re using alt tags and using high-priority keywords when appropriate.

<strong>Structured Data Mark-up</strong>

Structured data mark-up can be added to your HTML in order to classify your page content and provide information on the page. In some cases, this can improve your representation in SERPs. Using schema mark-up can help you ensure your content is fully optimised.

<strong>Social Media Sharing</strong>

There are so many huge benefits to sharing blogs on social media. It can help you ensure your social media feed is relevant and current and regular posting allows your customer base to stay engaged. It can also help improve SEO results as social media channels are included in the algorithm and it helps to increase referral traffic."
"All of us could count ourselves as social media marketers. Whether we’re freelancers, have a side-hustle we share with our friends on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter or you have a page for our business, it counts. Therefore, it makes sense for us to utilise our social media presence in the same way big brands do!

Instagram is a great platform for businesses as it offers a huge level of support for brands and, due to the sheer number of Instagram influencers, there are opportunities to access targeted audiences that can meet your brand’s niche.

This blog aims to offer you a guide on how to use Instagram in a way that can truly benefit your business.

Firstly, ensure your feed has a cohesive, consistent look. We all know about how important it is for our business to curate a brand but many businesses don’t apply that same philosophy to their social media pages. Use presets or specific filters to give all of your photos a similar feel and ensure your content is posted consistently.

It’s important for you to actually be a part of the community. For example, if you are a kitchenware brand, involve yourself in the cooking side of Instagram. Connect and engage with people by following, liking and commenting but ensure it stays authentic. People don’t like phony brands and can spot them from a mile away. Don’t forget to integrate community created content in your feed. It shows you value you your customers, your followers and your fans.

As mentioned previously, Instagram is probably the most supportive social media platform for brands and it’s important to take advantage! Instagram is where your base and your customers are so it’s vital to seize the opportunity. If you’re selling goods, ensure you’re using the shoppable posts feature. Make sure your images a beautiful, clear and that your account is linked to an active Facebook account.

Make sure you’re organised. Create a content calendar that allows you to prepare posts for big sales, holidays or events and even just keep your day to day posting consistent. Front-load this work so you can release these posts when they’re most effective.

Using templates is another great way to ensure consistency throughout your platforms. These are created by professionals so can help you get a coherent look throughout your posts even if you don’t have an artistic eye and allows you to change the aspect ratio for posting to different mediums.

Hashtags are a fantastic way to find your niche and expand your reach on Instagram. You can also create a specific hashtag, encourage your followers to post with that same hashtag and allow the community to go viral without doing 100% of the work."
"It’s impossible to predict your perfect marketing strategy right away. It takes time, audience research and data to inform your business’ future marketing moves. However, that doesn’t mean it has to be guesswork.

In fact, it’s crucial that you utilise all the resources you have to avoid wasting time, money and resources on a failing policy. One vital tool is your analytics data and we aim to help you figure out how to use this to structure a fantastic marketing strategy that works for you.

It can be difficult to establish which platforms are right for your business. However, some of it is just common sense. For example, using Pinterest to promote your legal advice firm will probably be less effective than using LinkdIn.

You can gain great insight by collecting and analysing data from all platforms to see which are performing better than others. This data can then impact on your strategy as you decide whether to adapt your activity, abandon it on platforms that aren’t working or even just take advantage of one platform’s activity rate.

You can learn a lot more from your analytics than which platform is most popular. It’s also a great way to determine the content your audience is really responding to. A mixture of content, such as company news, industry updates and more timeless content, is a great way to impact your audience and your analytics will reflect this.

Timeless, evergreen content like blogs, infographics and videos that don’t age and can be shared multiple times over time can perform really well. This doesn’t mean you won’t ever have to update it but by reviewing your analytics and changing things when necessary, audiences will still click through to view these pieces of content.

This blog isn’t an exhaustive list of how you can improve your marketing strategy but a cost-effective suggestion on how to utilise tools at your disposal to help your business thrive."
"Customer feedback has always been an important part of any business but thanks to social media, it is more visible than ever. This means the potential impact of both positive and negative reviews has been taken to a whole new level. It’s important for modern businesses to take advantage and use this in their existing marketing strategy.

Reviews can be hugely beneficial, especially for businesses savvy enough to capitalise on them. They can lead to improvements in the business and inform decisions. However, it’s important to utilise the comments on social media as well as feedback that is actively requested.

Find time to respond to the good, bad and the odd. Becoming a part of the conversation and acknowledging feedback means your business puts its message across.

Though it’s not always pleasant, it’s important to respond to negative feedback. Try to take it in impartially and, if it feels unfair, take a deep breath and lose your defensiveness before you start your response. Depending on the issue, it might be wise to start with an apology. It’s also a good idea to thank people for their time and their feedback so you can establish you’re responding and listening in good faith. If you need to explain the situation or you think you can rectify things with a phone call, make sure you do. In addition, if the review has led to any changes, make sure the client knows this. It’s likely that they will appreciate that action has been taken.

It can be risky, but if the review genuinely is unfair, it can be reasonable to push back or disagree. Make sure you’re respectful and explain your position and your confidence in the products or services you provide.

Responding to positive feedback is a great way to cultivate a great relationship with your customer base and potentially encourage brand loyalty. It’s never smart to pay for reviews but a simple thank you goes an awfully long way. Keep it personal and acknowledge what the review said. For example, if someone leaves a review that says they were celebrating their anniversary, wish them a happy anniversary. Be upbeat about them visiting you again.

Not only do positive reviews feel nice, they’re also very valuable. It’s important for you to properly capitalise on them as they can help your SEO so encourage people to leave feedback. You can also ask if they consent to their review being featured on your site or your promotional materials. You can also highlight high ratings on sites such as Trustpilot on your website."
"If you’re looking for content strategy that works, it’s important both your target audience and search engines love it.

A lot of marketers try to focus content on writing for search engines, which results in content that isn’t helpful or interesting. This alienates the people looking at the site and search engine algorithms are sophisticated enough to recognise poorly written content. This makes the content unfit for purpose all while making your site look unprofessional to the very few people that might have been able to access it.

So, you know that both people and search engines like content that is well-written but how do you ensure it’s suitably optimised so plenty of people can see it?

It is absolutely crucial that the content on your site resonates with your audience. This could be a blog on an interesting topic, news about the company and even industry news. We recommend that you build a list of timeless topics that you can supplement with more topical posts as and when they arise.

Now you have high-quality content, it’s time to make sure it’s properly optimised. This means it should load quickly on all devices and have a clear URL.

SEO practices encompass a range of tactics, but keywords remain crucial when correctly implemented. For example, long-tail keywords are ideal for articles as these are often what people will search.

Separate your content with subheadings, bullet points and numbers to allow both readers and search engines to gain a greater understanding as to what your site covers and which parts are the most important sections.

Utilise title tags and meta descriptions. The title should state what the content contains and the meta description should entice your audience to click through. These are both important as they allow the content to be properly indexed and bring your readers in.

When you add images to your content, make the files as small as you can without impacting the quality. This will allow your site to load more quickly, which is something search engines take into account when recommending your page. Ensure your image alt-tag has a description of what the photo contains.

This blog has outlined the basics in optimisation. It is important to keep in mind that, primarily, you are writing for your audience. Not only will this help you cultivate a great relationship with them, but it will be recognised by the search engines too."
"There are three major things your website requires to outrank your competition: the best content you can produce, a great distribution plan, great site optimisation.

When you look almost anything up on google, you’ll be met with hundreds of millions of results. Google digs through this content and finds the most useful so the first page boasts nothing but quality. As an average user, you don’t need to know how google does this but as a business owner, it’s vital to understand so you can take advantage.

There are over two hundred ranking factors, but the overarching one is determining which sites excel in being useful to their users.

It’s crucial to have a firm understanding of what you’re offering. This allows you to establish your target audience and then you can decide which kind of website is most beneficial to your needs. Many site owners don’t think this far ahead. Be better than them.

Once you’ve established the type of website is right for you and who you want to visit your site, it’s time to get people seeing it. This is where keywords come in.

Ensure these keywords accurately reflect what you’re offering without being too vague. For example, you’re unlikely to beat out the big-brand competition with “shoes for men” and, even if you did, you risk bringing people to your site without having what they’re looking for. Being more specific and choosing “summer shoes for men” is more likely to help. It’s also important that your keywords have a high search value so you can convert those searchers into clients.

Once you have established your keywords, it’s time to incorporate them into high quality content. The standards for content are incredibly high but the core principle is the same: give people the best version of what they’re looking for. This means ensuring your site is user friendly, the information it contains is accurate and detailed and that it offers real solutions to your audience’s problems.

After you’ve established your audience and worked on ensuring your content is of the highest quality, it’s time to make sure your audience actually sees it. This is why keywords are so vital. Though you may have ideas of your own, it’s important that you use ones that are effective. ElevateOM’s search engine optimisation service can take all of the guess work out of keywords and phrases by utilising our state-of-the-art technology that allows us to even narrow keywords down to your local area."
"The benefits of mobile friendly sites cannot be overstated. More people than ever before use their mobile devices or tablets as their primary way to access the internet. Almost 50% of purchases made online in 2019 are made using a mobile device. That’s a huge number of people that you could be shutting out of your business by not having a website that is inviting to all users.

A well-executed responsive website design will ensure that navigation and images adapt well to the mobile experience. On mobile, the text becomes even more important because of the limited space available. When writing content for your mobile site, strive to be concise, purposeful, and readable with headers and callouts to help your reader quickly navigate your site's information. Remember to keep your calls to action especially prominent on mobile with easy-to-read buttons or call outs.

In addition to just being generally frustrating, not having a mobile friendly site can negatively affect your website’s SEO ranking. This means that even the people trying to find you on a computer won’t necessarily be able to find you. Most companies aren’t willing to throw away an audience of 50% of buyers but even if you were, this negative effect on your ranking can cause you to lose other customers too.

Create a streamlined and consistent experience across all devices by ensuring your mobile site looks fantastic! This allows your brand to be instantly recognisable and more likely to complete conversions.

Mobile friendliness is great for your business. No ifs ands or buts. Using a mobile friendly, responsive web design can increase your search engine rankings by 77.59% according to one study. Making your site attractive allows mobile users to stay on longer, which makes them more likely to follow on your call to action.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to grow your business and don’t throw away vital clients. Adapt to the changing world and use all the tools at your disposal to make your organisation as appealing as possible."
"We all know that providing excellent customer service is a key factor for a successful business. This blog post aims to offer you online business customer service tips and tricks so you make the most of what the internet has to offer your organisation.

To provide great service, you need to know your product or service well. Be aware of the types of questions your customers are likely to ask and ensure you and all your customer facing staff have all the answers and answers to follow up questions.

Make sure you’re friendly. Even when handling issues entirely online, keep your tone on any emails as personable and professional as possible. If you work on the phone, make sure you smile while chatting. It can really change the tone of your voice and make you seem a lot happier to deal with your clients.

Make sure your staff understand what you expect from them. Ensure you have a consistent tone, way of speaking and way of interacting with customers. Even if a staff member is unlikely to interact with customers, they should still be aware of the expectations. This sets the entire company up for success.
Customer service is often emotional. Your clients deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. Be respectful throughout any interactions even if you feel frustrated or upset. It is vital you keep your client happy. Further to this, make sure you’re responding to the clients’ needs, frustrations and queries. Answer emails quickly and try to get back to clients as quickly as possible.

Ask for feedback, both negative and positive. This shows you exactly what you’re doing right and the issues you need to improve upon. It is vital that you act on this feedback. Knowing that clients are frustrated with the time it takes to get a response is only important if you’re planning to rectify this issue.

By ensuring your customer service is excellent, your company can retain clients even if there are issues. This is why it is vital that you are able to work and adapt to keep your customers as happy as possible."
"Which Social Media Platform is Most Effective for your Business? How Social Media Management can Help your Business

The number of platforms out there can feel overwhelming for any business. So is Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and twitter social media management right for your firm?

There are lots of different types of social media out there now and it’s important to understand which is going to be more effective for your business. Social media management will ensure you’re using the right platform for your target audience.

By being on social media, you make your business or organisation more discoverable. This leads to a more natural likelihood to being found by new potential customers. It also allows you to build and cultivate great and natural relationships with your customers. Social media is perfect for building a brand and showing your company’s personality. Not only will this bring you new followers and customers but it will also widen your recruitment pool. Like minded people will see your work and realise you foster the kind of environment they want to work in.

Before deciding where to focus your social media management efforts, you need to decide a plan. What do you want from these services? By establishing these objectives, you can save time, money and resources by focusing on achieving these goals.

Figure out who exactly you’re trying to reach and clearly outline your target audience. Make it as specific as possible: age, location, interests and many more factors are relevant in working to meet your goals. This allows you to narrow down which platforms are right for your audience.

Once you’ve determined what you’re doing and who you’re doing it for, it’s time to decide on your brand’s tone and online personality. Are you a fun company or more formal? Do you want to share memes or just focus on the products themselves? Different companies have different answers to these questions and it’s important to think about.

Plan your content. If your brand is something that naturally lends itself to visual marketing, instagram might be the ideal place for you. No matter where you focus your efforts, ensure the posts are scheduled and regular. It is so important to be consistent on these sites as it not only builds better relationships with potential customers but also makes your content more attractive to the algorithm and ensures more people see it.

Whether you’re just starting out with social media marketing or are looking to reconsider your strategy, social media management can take the stress and hassle out of this for you."
"The benefits of running a successful Google Ads campaign with a professional company cannot be overstated. Search engine marketing has been a great tool for years but the industry is getting increasingly complicated. It’s not enough to place an ad in 2019. You have to understand an always-changing system and be able to stay one step ahead of the competition. Doing that is a full time job in and of itself and it is almost impossible to do that while running your successful business.

The update from Google AdWords to Google Ads brings many new features such as an increase in automated and smart options with new and updated tools that are integrated into the Google Marketing platform.

The new features open up possibilities for professionals. However, these same features could confuse and discourage novice search advertisers.

The use of voice search is changing the way keywords are used. People are abandoning typing and using their voice assistants to answer their questions for them. Because of the semantic differences between actually speaking to typing, search engines are having to adapt to a whole new way of receiving requests. One major trend in Google Ads in 2019 is that context will matter almost as much as keywords. This means content must be written in a way that naturally includes keywords and phrases but also has the context necessary to develop alongside the new technology.

User signals are becoming more important too. This is the action a user takes when on your site. If they click a link and then immediately leave your site, this can negatively affect your rankings. This means that it is more important than ever to ensure keywords and phrases are relevant to your products and services.

Remarketing is a fantastic tool for advertisers and Google ads is making it more prominent than ever before. If someone clicks on a product or even adds it to their cart without buying it, you can be assured that they’re interested in the product. By remarketing things they are already interested in, you give the customer an incentive to revisit your site and, hopefully, start purchasing.

An already complicated sector is only becoming more overwhelming in 2019. This makes it even more vital that businesses looking to succeed online work with SEM professionals to ensure they don’t miss out on revenue and waste their time and money."
"The benefits of SEO on your site cannot be overstated. We aim to give you a guide and show you what our professionals consider with our successful SEO packages.

In 2019, search engines are focusing on evaluating content quality and at the depth and breadth of a website’s content. Sites that provide great depth of knowledge and understanding are ranking higher than those that are slightly weaker in the area. In the past few months, the rankings of sites with quality content have been skyrocketing. This is something you definitely don’t want your business to miss out on.

One of the most important things you need to understand is what people searching for keywords and phrases are actually looking for. It matters that your content is good but even if the content is perfectly written, it might not get seen if it’s not exactly what your audience wants. That just won’t grow your business. It’s becoming increasingly important as ranks are fluctuating to fit with semantic intent. Make sure your content answers any questions your consumers may have and consider making sure any follow up questions they have are covered too.

Prepare for voice search. Experts don’t think it’s quite time for voice search to take over mobile or computer searches but the number of people using their voice assistants is increasing. It’s always good to be prepared for changes and trends in the market, which is why we recommend you work on this now.

Establish your expertise, authority and trustworthiness (known as E-A-T). This can involve working with experts to author content, leverage data from known entities, and ensure credentials and credit are a focus. Make sure that your company is the expert in the field, the firm that journalists come to when looking for more understanding of the subject and emphasise your knowledge of the core subject.

This guide is not exhaustive but it really does show you just how vital it is to adapt your content for a modern and changing algorithm. Our experts are perfectly placed to give you all the tools necessary to help your business thrive."
"We all know that reviews matter but do we really know exactly how reviews can help your online business? This blog aims to hep you understand why reviews matter in 2019 and how to increase the number of reviews your business gets.

The major reason reviews matter is that potential customers care about them. The number of reviews affect social proof and how your business is viewed. Ensure you have plenty of new, updated reviews that show that old issues have been resolved. Even if you didn’t have negative reviews before, the lack of new reviews makes people wary of working with you. These old reviews don’t necessarily reflect the business’ current reputation and the customer service experienced by recent shoppers. Don’t leave people guessing if your service is the same in 2019 as it was in 2014. These reviews also help you stand out from the competition and help build a relationship of trust between you and your potential consumers.

You understand why reviews are important but just how do you get more customers to leave reviews?

First thing’s first: make it simple. Show your customers that you’re eager to hear how their experience was and that their voice is valued in your organisation.

You can also try rewarding your customers. Now, we’re not saying pay for reviews. That’s not honest and is unlikely to garner genuine opinions. However, you can offer rewards or entry into a monthly prize draw. Just something that entices people to tell you how they feel.

Sending a follow up email is also a great idea. Etsy contacts customers and asks them to leave a review and reported that 25% customers leave a review as a result. Pretty impressive. Email is cost effective and can pay out dividends. Send this requests out quickly but not too quickly. Allow people to actually experience the product or service but ensure the purchase is still fresh in their mind.

Another way to majorly improve responses is to make it easy! A blank text box can feel intimidating. Use a star system or ask questions for them to answer in their review such as: why they bought the product, would they buy again, would they shop with your store again etc. By making a review a simple task, you’ll encourage many more people to give feedback.

Ensure your review page is mobile friendly. More people than ever are using their phone or tablet as their primary access to the internet. Don’t miss out on potential reviewers by making your page inaccessible to them.

Make sure to thank reviewers regularly. Maybe just spend 15 minutes once a week going through, addressing what was written in the review and cultivate a great, personal relationship with clients.

Reviews truly are vital for many businesses and this guide should give you all the tools you need to get as many of them as possible."
"When looking at creating a great online business, many of us want to know how to build a successful ecommerce site. This blog post aims to offer you a guide to what customers find attractive and necessary when purchasing from an ecommerce store.

Ensure your site is user friendly. Online sellers don’t have a lot of time to make a sale. In fact, experts estimate have minutes, if not seconds to close the deal. Make sure the user experience is as easy and functional as possible by providing shopping categories, filters, and comparison capabilities
You want to help shoppers get to what they want faster and without running into unnecessary complexity that can clog up the path to purchase.
One key aspect of making the site more user friendly is to make absolutely sure it works well on mobile devices. Mobile shopping accounts for around 50% of online purchases and you cannot alienate a huge potential consumer base.

Make sure the products are presented well and accurately. This means using high resolution photographs and showing the product in a range of different uses and environments.

Another essential for ecommerce sites is reviews. We wrote a whole guide to getting more reviews in April that is definitely worth taking a look at. Briefly, encourage existing users to leave reviews with incentives like rewards or follow up with them after a purchase. These reviews will lead to an increase in sales, which should in turn lead to more reviews. It’s a fantastic cycle.

Promote special offers. When customers believe they’re getting a limited time deal, it encourages them to spend more time on the site and spend more money. If you have a constant “offers” page, this can improve your SEO too!

Another thing to explore is a wishlist option. This allows people to save and bookmark items that they can then come back and purchase at a later date. It’s a remarketing dream!

Add a related items feature. This can both increase sales and help build a relationship with the client and make them feel like your store just understands them.

Finally, add an FAQ page. Not only does this show that you’re ready to answer questions, queries and follow ups but also allows you more time to focus on what makes your business great rather than answering emails about returns. In fact, if that sort of information is not readily available on your site, it can lead to decrease in trust and make people less likely to purchase from you."
"It’s still the New Year and one thing we all need in 2019 is website tips and tricks. When someone visits your site, can they tell what you do within a few seconds? Is it easy to navigate? Is it showcasing your best work? If the answer to these questions is no, then you need to work on improving your website.

Create a first impression that reflects you as a brand or a business. Keep the information unique but ensure you make it clear:
•	What You Do
•	Your Call to Action
•	How and where to Find Information

One simple way to ensure your website is easy to read and navigate is to remove distracting animations, get rid stock photos that seem to appear on every website and ensure the content written on your site is engaging and high quality.

Audiences have an attention span of around eight seconds. That’s not a long time to show your potential clients that your services or products are worth their time or that you’re a step above your competitors. Keep the information easy to digest with headings, applicable photos and graphs as well as unique content that lays out what you do and why you’re the best at it.

The content also works as a tool to help your site gain an online visibility by allowing you to use keywords that can help with search engine optimisation. Correct usage of keywords and phrases increases the likelihood that your site will place higher on the results of search engines. What is the point of having a beautiful website if no one is going to see it? This is why keywords are so vital.

When creating your content, avoid words that you see all the time: innovative, next generation, synergy etc. These are featured on so many websites and don’t necessarily make your work more appealing.

More people than ever before are using their phones rather than a computer to find goods and services. This means it is more important than ever to ensure your site works perfectly on mobiles and tablets. You don’t want to miss out on a great consumer base by not making yourself accessible to all of the people searching for what you offer.

This list is not comprehensive but this is a great starting point to make sure your website is working as well as possible and bringing you the right sort of traffic."
"If you’re looking for insight in how marketing campaigns can help your site gain an online presence, engaging an SEO professional might be exactly what you need. This blog aims to guide you through everything you need to know.

SEO can get rather complicated, especially for those who are new to digital marketing.

While shopping for SEO services online, you have probably seen a range of SEO companies.

"Having high quality, interesting content is massively beneficial to your website. This sets you apart from the rest of the pack and communicates to your clients that you’re a firm that takes your job seriously and you’re committed to quality.

Of course, having well written content that utilises keywords and phrases will increase the chance of your website doing well in search engine results. What’s the point in having a stunning website if no one will see it? Unique content allows you to reflect your keyword strategy in an organic way. Keywords are the terms that you want to be found for online and that best describe your products or services. However, the content isn’t just for the search engines.

Your content should give your customers all the information they need as quickly as they need it. This will keep them on your site longer and make them more likely to make a purchase or follow a call to action.

One of the most important reasons to have great, unique content is to provide a call to action to your clients. A call to action is an invitation to users to complete an action. A calls to action could be asking for your audience to: contact you, request a quote, add to cart, leave a review or anything in between. Whatever it is you want users to do on your website. These calls to action throughout your site may help to increase conversions through your website
Content is absolutely vital in making your website stand out. Have real, interesting and well-written content if you’re looking to increase your client base, create a recurring audience or just improve your SEO."
"If you’re looking to promote your offers to your target audience, Google Ads could be the perfect tool for you.

What is Google Ads? It’s Google’s online advertising platform that allows you to create online ads to reach audiences who are interested in the products and services you offer. This runs on a Pay-per-click (PPC) basis so you pay every time a visitor clicks on your ad.

Google ads allows you to reach an international audience and reach people that are actually likely to be interested using personalisation and segmentation.

Google Ads platform can be thought of as an online marketplace. Businesses pay to have their ads ranked at the top of the search results page or displayed prominently on other websites.
Google Ads (previously known as AdWords) updated its brand name and some of its advertising capabilities in 2018. This updated platform merges multiple marketing capacities to deliver more accurate insights to audiences through machine learning and AI.

<strong>How does Google Ads work?</strong>
Google Ads operate on what can essentially be called an auction system. A user types a query in the search engine Google goes through the platform’s advertisers pool and decides whether there should be an auction. If more than one advertiser is bidding on a keyword, which Google decides is relevant to the user’s search query, an auction is automatically triggered.

It’s important to note that keywords are not necessarily search queries. Specific keywords such as ‘time management tools’ may be entered into the auction for a large number of search queries, such as ‘Saas tools for time management’ or ‘Tools to save time’.
Google advertisers bid on the keywords, not the search queries. Not only do they decide how much they want to spend, they also have the ability to create keywords groups that are then paired with ads and post-click landing pages that correspond with the keywords.
Google enters the keyword that seems the most relevant into the auction with the maximum bid you’ve set along with the specific ad and this is what the user sees.

Users looking to get a high quality score and improve Ad Rank need to understand that it is extremely important to take care of keyword, ad and post-click landing page relevance as well as to set an appropriate maximum bid for their campaigns."
"More and more people are shopping and researching products online, which means it has become critical for companies to recognize the importance of Internet marketing. When you see how effective Internet marketing is, you can start growing your business in new and innovative ways and this guide is here to help you get started.

With so many of us using the internet every single day, not using one of the most incredible tools as your disposal is just negligent.

Meet your clients where they live, work, entertain, shop and get all the information they need. Even if you’re a local business, your clients are still online. Focus on creating tailored content that ensures the people you’re trying to entice are the people that see your site.

Online marketing allows you to create a dialogue with your customers. Traditional advertising is a one-way street but Internet marketing allows potential clients to ask questions, double check any concerns they have and be seen as much more than just a number.

Your audience wants to believe that they matter to your business and online marketing allows you to create a completely personalised experience. When people find your site, they’re coming for a myriad of different reasons. A personalised experience allows you to create a better experience for your leads, which increases the chance of making conversions.

In traditional advertising, you don’t know how many valuable leads you will reach. Your advertisements appear in front of interested and uninterested leads, which makes it difficult to drive an abundance of quality traffic. When you use Internet marketing, on the other hand, you drive more qualified traffic. You reach more leads that are interested in your business. The ability to target specific leads helps you drive traffic that takes interest in your company.

Your competitors are using online marketing. Why give them an automatic advantage or allow them to take customers that would be perfect for you? Keep up with your competition by establishing an effective marketing campaign. Step ahead by being the best at what you do."
"The benefits of social media for a business are hard to overstate. Whether you run a small shop or a huge multi-national business, social media is still vital for your business. These platforms allow you to connect with customers and potential clients and increase awareness of your brand.

If someone doesn’t know your business exists, how can they become a client? Of course, the answer is they can’t! Social media can boost your visibility to a wide audience. Plus, it’s free! This is a cost effective marketing tool that every business can benefit from.

Make sure you have a strategy in place so that you’re utilising social media effectively and properly. Do you need to exclusively focus on local people or are you looking for an international audience? These are questions you need to ask while creating your social media plan.

It’s important that you allow your company’s personality shine through. People aren’t receptive to bland, corporate posts any more! Decide whether you want to be casual and fun or more formal and friendly. No matter what, keep it professional but keep in mind that you’re allowed to show that you’re a real person, not a corporate robot!

Look for ways to show your potential clients and customers that you’re a real leader in your sector. Use your social media to communicate your authority and give them confidence in your skills and ability.

Social media platforms are always evolving and giving you new ways to engage with your potential customers so make sure you take advantage. Hold a question and answer session on instagram live. This can double as a way to show your clients you know exactly what you’re talking about.

Develop a reputation for being quick and effective in terms of customer service. If there’s a problem, talk directly to the consumer and go out of your way to be receptive, positive and make your client feel heard.

Social media is a vital and unavoidable part of running a business. However, it doesn’t need to be stressful to manage. This guide aims to give you the tools to get started."
"When dipping into online business, a lot of the terminology can seem a bit overwhelming. This blog aims to guide you and help you understand SEO and exactly how SEO works.

SEO is Search Engine Optimisation. Essentially, the process of getting traffic from search engines in a natural way and without advertisements.
Search engine optimisation can get a little bit complicated when it comes to all the different factors that impact your ranking. However, the basic process is not as difficult to understand. Search engines want to provide the best service for their users. This means delivering results on the search engine pages that are not only high quality but also relevant to what the searcher is looking for.
In order to find high quality, relevant materials, search engines will crawl different websites to better understand what the site is about. This helps them deliver more relevant results to those who are searching for certain topics or keywords. Furthermore the search engines will determine how easy it is to navigate and read and then reward user-friendly sites with higher rankings on the search engine results page.
If you have plenty of quality, relevant content pieces on your site, the search engines will be more likely to rank your pages higher on the search engine results page. In addition, the more engaging and effective content you have on your site, the more likely your visitors will be to spend some quality time on your website and maybe even make a purchase. This is why content is so vital for your site.
One important thing to consider when creating content for your site is SEO keywords and phrases. SEO keywords are words and phrases that a search engine user might type in when looking for answers to their questions or relevant products and services. When you create content around these keywords and phrases, you improve your chances of ranking higher for these keywords on the search engine results page.
However, you do need to be cautious with keywords. It’s important to avoid over optimisation. Google and other search engines will penalise your page if it attempts to use keywords too many times throughout the content.
This is just an introduction to SEO and we hope that it has answered some of your most pressing questions."
"If you’ve heard about how vital Google Analytics is for business growth or you’re curious about using Google Analytics to benefit a website, this explainer aims to give you all the answers you’ve been looking for.

Analytics provides vital insights that can help you mould and change the success strategy of your business. Whether you own an ecommerce operation or an informative blog, it’s great to understand the business aspects of it.

Google Analytics gives you the tools to track and understand your customer's behaviour, what they're looking for, and whether your business is addressing their needs. It allows you to use its technology to study your online business so you can cater well to your customers. If you want to deliver effectively to your customers, you need to understand exactly who they are.

One key aspect you can learn from analytics is where your customers have come from. If your clients are mainly coming from their mobile, is it financially viable to investigate a dedicated mobile app?

Another great thing you can get from analytics is which geographical area most of your customers are coming from. Understanding this about your customers helps you formulate marketing strategies and solutions that address their needs. You'll also be able to determine whether there is a growing potential for your products and your services.

You can also target your marketing to benefit new customers without alienating your existing client base.

Google Analytics gives you the information necessary to segment your client base. Each one of your customers is different. They react to your website differently and they perform different actions on it. Using Advanced Segments feature allows you to classify your customers based on certain factors.

When you’re embarking on a new campaign, it’s vital to see if it’s working. To draw attention to your business, you need to create campaigns that reach out to your customers. You also need to measure the impact these campaigns have on your client base. See which emails are bringing people in and which are not so you don’t continue to waste time or money that you could be putting into making your business great.

Google Analytics allows you to add goals and track them. This can help you track how well your business is progressing. By setting goals and studying the results, you can formulate or change existing plans and strategies to make them as effective as possible. You can investigate what’s making people leave your site without converting by using these tools too!"
"Running your business is difficult enough as it is. Finding the time to do everything you need to do, working out what needs to be prioritised and dealing with emergencies is a real challenge. Add trying to focus on marketing on top of that and you’re overwhelmed!

We all know maintaining contact with your target audience is essential for growth but expecting a small business owner to keep in regular contact with their contacts is not realistic. If you’re looking to bridge the communication gap, regular email newsletters are an time efficient, cost effective way of allowing you to communicate with all of your connections and foster and cultivate great relationships.

We understand that business owners don’t have a lot of time. By utilising templates and using content you’ve probably already written if you’re keeping up with your social media, you can create long-lasting relationships with your clients and your contacts. This is why email newsletters are important. They make sure your clients feel like they matter and are a vital consumer.

Don’t worry, though, you don’t have to be a technical whizz to create a newsletter. There’s a lot of great software out there that’s easy to use and creates beautiful, professional newsletters for your clients.

There are very few marketing tools that allow you to communicate with such a huge number of people in such a cost effective way. This means you get an incredible return on investment when utilising newsletters.

Take advantage of technology that allows you to track the results of your email campaign effectively and in real-time. This is pretty much unique to email newsletters and very unlike most other marketing methods.

Being able to monitor who opened your email and which links they clicked on is hugely valuable as it allows you to determine which prospects are engaging with your content. It also allows you to measure exactly which aspects of your content is proving to be of value to your readers.

Whether you’re running a new business and are looking for tips and tricks or you’re curious about what the benefits of a newsletter are for you website, this thorough guide should have answered any and all questions you may have."
"The search engine optimisation (SEO) industry didn’t experience dramatic updates and changes that have been standard in previous years. However, a lot more has changed than you probably realised. If you’re interested in Google changes that took place in 2017, check out this guide.

Smart speakers and digital assistants like Google Now, Siri, and Cortana are changing the way people are searching for information. A much larger percentage of searches are now focused on getting bite-sized pieces of information such as facts, locations, figures, and statuses, as opposed to searching for full-sized web pages. This shift to smaller pieces of information is creating more personalisation especially as these assistants use much more of your search history than Google has historically. This shift means that building a rapport with your clients and customer base is more important than ever.

Another big change has been a growing focus on ‘people also ask’ questions. Smartphone users are far less likely to use their keyboards and Google’s digital assistant is limited in its interpretation. This has caused the value of these suggested searches to go through the roof and so has their prevalence in the search results.

As well as ‘people also ask’ questions, Google results also lifts answers from web pages which draws extra focus to those pages. This may mean that for a web page to be as valuable as possible in 2017 and the years to come, it must be providing answers and solving problems that can’t be solved in a few short sentences.

It was inevitable but it finally happened: 2017 was the year that mobile search traffic outpaced the traffic from desktop searches. Mobile devices and tablets are now the default devices of the typical searcher. This makes it even more vital than ever before to create a site that is just as beautiful and functional on mobile devices as it is on a desktop. There are few things more frustrating than being unable to access a site that has your perfect product because you’re not at your computer."
"Social Media marketing is a great way for businesses to set up new leads and, ultimately, increase your return on investment. Social Media marketing in 2017 is a different beast than it used to be. More and more people understand that Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are invaluable tools in reaching your target audience. This guide aims to offer practical, tangible advice to take advantage of these tools and begin implementing them in your own marketing plans.

<strong>Use Snapchat</strong>
About 10 billion snaps are watched per day by 100 million users. That’s a huge number of people! Snapchat allows users to add a logo or design to their snaps and your business could benefit from these cost-effective interactive marketing tools. It costs around $5 to create a Geofilter for your brand or event.

<strong>Get Specific on Facebook</strong>
Facebook’s ad manager tool allows you to create an audience based on very specific criteria. One of the more useful of which is the ability to target by Life Events. If your business works with services perfect for weddings, you can ensure you advertise to the recently engaged as they are most likely to be interested in your products.

You can also target people based on a huge number of criteria: from interests, recent behaviour, estimated income, relationship status to education level and many more. You can use these types of filters can help you narrow down your audience so you’re only focusing on people likely to be interested in your services or products.

<strong>Make it Look Good</strong>
It sounds obvious but you need to ensure your advertisements actually make people want to click through. Make it striking and interesting but still keep your potential customers relaxed enough to actually want to visit your site.

<strong>Take Advantage of Remarketing</strong>
The most likely people to buy your products are people that have purchased or shown interest in them before. Display items they showed interest in before (by adding to their cart for example) to entice them back to your site. This is a great way to have another chance at converting interest into an actual sale."
"To perform well online, a website needs more than pretty pictures and a beautiful layout (though, of course, those help). This guide should help you ensure you make the right decisions and avoid some of the usual problems so you can have the best website launch campaign possible.

<strong>Create Quality Content</strong>
Before you launch, ensure you have a few pieces of quality content ready to go so your clients see excellent pieces that are valuable to your niche.
From How-to guides to FAQs or even a glossary of industry terminology, make sure the content you’re showcasing is great.

<strong>Utilise SEO Expertise</strong>
Use your keywords in strategic areas of your page. Consistently add fresh, unique new content that also utilises keywords that are right for your business and sector. Also, it is vital that your site is mobile and tablet compatible. You don’t want to shut out a huge section of potential clients and customers who don’t initially visit your site through a computer.

<strong>Install Google Analytics</strong>
Google Analytics is a free tool that can help you discern which of your strategies are working and, more importantly, which aren’t. By installing the program, you can see how many visits your site is getting and where the traffic is coming from.

<strong>Utilise Google Search Console</strong>
If you add your site, you’ll be able to use a variety of tools that are designed to manage the health of your site in terms of search engine optimisation. If there are any issues with your site, you’ll be notified so you can make sure your site is reaching its potential.

<strong>Set up a Pre-Launch Page</strong>
If your site isn’t ready to go live just yet, that doesn’t mean your website should just sit empty. Promote the launch with a countdown page and build anticipation and excitement for your new venture."
"Whether you’re running a small business or a larger venture, your website is equally as vital for your growth.

One of the most important aspects of a company’s brand is their website. However, just having a website isn’t all that matters anymore. Companies and organisations need to take the layout, design and user experience into account too! Building a website or ecommerce store has never been easier, which is why ensuring your clients have a great experience on your site matters more than ever.

<strong>Tell Your Story</strong>
Your potential clients and customers are interested in you and your organisation’s story. When people feel an emotional connection to you, they’re more likely to pursue their interest in your brand further.

<strong>Tell People who you are and what you do</strong>
Having a beautiful website matters but clients need to know what you’re offering. By making your services clear, you’re giving potential customers the confidence in your ability that they’re looking for.

<strong>Ensure your Website has a Responsive Design</strong>
Take into account that not everyone will be visiting your website from a computer. In this day and age, more and more people need a website to function beautiful on their phone and their tablet too. Ensure your website is inviting to a wide range of people by adapting your site for everyone.

<strong>Prioritise the Customers’ Experience</strong>
Make sure your clients don’t have the trawl through vast amounts of content to understand what you do. Having multiple videos might be a good idea or it might make the site more difficult to navigate. Ensure your clients can easily access all the information they might need to be confident about working with you.

<strong>Tell Your Clients Why You’re Different</strong>
You’ve told your clients WHAT you do but have you told them why they should come to you rather than a competitor? That’s a vital part of any marketing especially your website. Show your potential customers that you’re not just another provider; you’re the right one for them.

<strong>Ensure Your Call to Action is Clear</strong>
If clients have to search for a way to contact you or get your products, your website isn’t doing its job! Make it clear what you’re offering and how your potential customers can get it. By being transparent about how your clients can get more information, you keep that emotional connection you gained from telling your story too."
