<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
Excluding business partners, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h3>Business Partners:</h3>
ElevateOM may share personal information with business partners. When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
 	<li>If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<h3>Marketing</h3>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
Excluding business partners, we will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
<h4>Business Partners:</h4>
ElevateOM may share personal information with business partners. When we share personal information with business partners, it will generally be subject to their privacy policy. We share information with business partners in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.</li>
 	<li>If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.</li>
</ul>
If you express interest in an offer presented to you either by ElevateOM on behalf of a business partner or by a business partner on behalf of ElevateOM, you are directing ElevateOM to provide information about you to that business partner.
If you purchase an ElevateOM product that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share information about you with that business partner.
<h3>Opting out</h3>
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by emailing us on marketing@Elevateom.com or by opting out of the marketing emails using the Unsubscribe facility when you receive them.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service or product purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions where we need the information to deliver the service for which you have engaged us.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.
<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 4 Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.
<ul>
 	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary in 10 below.</li>
 	<li>Specific third parties listed in the table in Section above.</li>
 	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
 	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

<strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<h3>External Third Parties</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Service providers acting as developers and processors based in India and Serbia who provide IT, system administration and website development services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Professional advisers some acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
By law we have to keep some basic information our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for 6 years after they cease being customers for tax purposes but subject to this:-

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to gain more information on this.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our data privacy manager the details for whom appear in section 1 of this policy.
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting usa599551.

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
You have the right to:

<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
 	<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
 	<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
 	<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent."

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With&nbsp;a&nbsp;myriad of&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;channels&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;tools&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;today,&nbsp;you might not think&nbsp;it&nbsp;is still&nbsp;appropriate to&nbsp;consider emails&nbsp;and newsletters&nbsp;as&nbsp;digital&nbsp;assets.&nbsp;Sadly, you’d be wrong -&nbsp;good old&nbsp;email marketing is still an&nbsp;effective communication&nbsp;channel&nbsp;if&nbsp;you follow a few simple ideas that remain&nbsp;consistent with&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;your&nbsp;onlinemarketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What is a newsletter?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">How to create an effective newsletter</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make this form&nbsp;of&nbsp;communication our ally, however, we need a well-qualified database of recipients&nbsp;of&nbsp;which we have&nbsp;pre-authorisation to&nbsp;send marketing material,&nbsp;and which is preferably&nbsp;sub-divided by specific interests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Gather Contact Info</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be able to&nbsp;effectively begin sending your customers a&nbsp;newsletter, particular attention must be paid to&nbsp;how we gather&nbsp;contact&nbsp;information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create valuable newsletter content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create personalised content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody likes to receive generic and impersonal&nbsp;marketing material – it’ll soon land you in their spam box. Personalised&nbsp;newsletters are much more effective because they show the reader that you have taken the time to understand their needs and that you are interested in them as an individual. A mistake that is made all too often is to focus on what you want to say, rather than what customers&nbsp;really&nbsp;want to know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Encourage a call to action</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTAs (Call To Action) are an indispensable tool to get your readers to take action.&nbsp;Having a high email-open rate is certainly a great place to start, but the ultimate goal of a newsletter is to get results. Through the CTAs, customers can be invited to interact&nbsp;with your newsletter&nbsp;in&nbsp;ways that will lead to results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best&nbsp;way&nbsp;is to ask&nbsp;them&nbsp;to click on a link or on a button that takes&nbsp;them&nbsp;back to your site or your social accounts.&nbsp;Stay away from&nbsp;using phrases such as "Buy Now", which can appear as commands, it is better to&nbsp;use&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;such as "Find out more" which are&nbsp;more&nbsp;polite invitations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"31px"} -->
<div style="height:31px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Use an email marketing platform</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a list and sending hundreds or thousands of emails manually is time-consuming and inefficient&nbsp;- this is where an email marketing platform comes in handy. They automate processes&nbsp;and&nbsp;offer&nbsp;detailed reports, customer segmentation options for sending targeted emails, and campaign management tools.&nbsp;These are essential if you want to increase the ROI of your email campaigns in an automated way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are numerous email marketing platforms and tools to choose from with different features, payment plans, and different levels of ease of use.</p>

<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

<p>To be able to&nbsp;effectively begin sending your customers a&nbsp;newsletter, particular attention must be paid to&nbsp;how we gather&nbsp;contact&nbsp;information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>

<p>Usually,&nbsp;at some point,&nbsp;users&nbsp;will be prompted to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;short&nbsp;form on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website. In some cases, this step can be encouraged by offering the user a&nbsp;discount on products or services, or a gift&nbsp;in exchange&nbsp;for their email address&nbsp;and contact info. Giving visitors a reason to&nbsp;subscribe&nbsp;to a newsletter&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;if you want to&nbsp;build a list of&nbsp;pre-qualified&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;to&nbsp;make this&nbsp;form of marketing&nbsp;truly effective.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effective newsletter&nbsp;should aim to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;a user's need and, at the same time, bring&nbsp;resultsto your marketing efforts&nbsp;– in this case, sales conversions.&nbsp;The success of sending a newsletter depends on many factors, some of which must be taken into consideration even before the drafting of the newsletter itself begins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, define&nbsp;the&nbsp;intent and&nbsp;goal of every newsletter you write, here are some examples:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;informative&nbsp;(if you need to communicate news, new products or changes)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;download content (if you are sending a lead magnet)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring traffic to&nbsp;your blog&nbsp;(if you have written a new article and want to have it read)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain information (if you have prepared a questionnaire for the reader to fill out)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;transform&nbsp;a&nbsp;prospect into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead (if you want them to&nbsp;explore a new product line)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell (if you have an eCommerce&nbsp;site)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;to&nbsp;recover an abandoned cart</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever your industry and business, it is important to reach your customers through&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;quality content. Whether it's sharing news about your products or services, announcing events, presenting offers or providing solutions to particular problems&nbsp;– overall, you mustoffer something unique and valuable. Think about what differentiates your brand from others and emphasise this in your newsletter, demonstrating your value proposition.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center">Create personalised content</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody likes to receive generic and impersonal&nbsp;marketing material – it’ll soon land you in their spam box. Personalised&nbsp;newsletters are much more effective because they show the reader that you have taken the time to understand their needs and that you are interested in them as an individual. A mistake that is made all too often is to focus on what you want to say, rather than what customers&nbsp;really&nbsp;want to know.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CTAs (Call To Action) are an indispensable tool to get your readers to take action.&nbsp;Having a high email-open rate is certainly a great place to start, but the ultimate goal of a newsletter is to get results. Through the CTAs, customers can be invited to interact&nbsp;with your newsletter&nbsp;in&nbsp;ways that will lead to results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best&nbsp;way&nbsp;is to ask&nbsp;them&nbsp;to click on a link or on a button that takes&nbsp;them&nbsp;back to your site or your social accounts.&nbsp;Stay away from&nbsp;using phrases such as "Buy Now", which can appear as commands, it is better to&nbsp;use&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;such as "Find out more" which are&nbsp;more&nbsp;polite invitations.</p>

<p>Creating a list and sending hundreds or thousands of emails manually is time-consuming and inefficient&nbsp;- this is where an email marketing platform comes in handy.

<p>With&nbsp;a&nbsp;myriad of&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;channels&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;tools&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;today,&nbsp;you might not think&nbsp;it&nbsp;is still&nbsp;appropriate to&nbsp;consider emails&nbsp;and newsletters&nbsp;as&nbsp;digital&nbsp;assets.&nbsp;Sadly, you’d be wrong -&nbsp;good old&nbsp;email marketing is still an&nbsp;effective communication&nbsp;channel&nbsp;if&nbsp;you follow a few simple ideas that remain&nbsp;consistent with&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;your&nbsp;onlinemarketing strategy.</p>

<h2>What is a newsletter?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A newsletter, which we can also call&nbsp;<em>email marketing&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>direct email</em>&nbsp;<em>marketing</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;web&nbsp;content sent periodically via&nbsp;an email marketing&nbsp;platform which uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;informationand&nbsp;email addresses of people&nbsp;whom&nbsp;we know&nbsp;have engaged or&nbsp;are interested&nbsp;in our products and services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the&nbsp;main&nbsp;objectives&nbsp;of this form of marketing&nbsp;is to establish a relationship of trust with those who receive&nbsp;a newsletter, and thus, is a&nbsp;great tool to use for&nbsp;growing&nbsp;small and medium-sized businesses, professional&nbsp;services and&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;sites.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center">How to create an effective newsletter</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>To make this form&nbsp;of&nbsp;communication our ally, however, we need a well-qualified database of recipients&nbsp;of&nbsp;which we have&nbsp;pre-authorisation to&nbsp;send marketing material,&nbsp;and which is preferably&nbsp;sub-divided by specific interests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like any communication and content marketing tool, it is important that at a newsletter’s coreis a strategy, objective, valuable content to share, a tone of voice and graphics that reflects your corporate message;&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;value&nbsp;to readers.</p>

"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In nearly every&nbsp;business&nbsp;department, monthly and/or yearly reports form among the most important tools for&nbsp;assessing the performance of past&nbsp;strategies and campaigns&nbsp;with which to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;new ideas and make&nbsp;future&nbsp;business&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, digital marketing reports should form a fundamental aspect of your online marketing activities. They should be used to monitor advertising performance and ROI (Return On Investment), help you make sensible tweaks and changes to user experience and help understand the impact that your communication channels are having on your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's&nbsp;take a look at a few advantages&nbsp;of&nbsp;monthly&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing reporting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"27px"} -->
<div style="height:27px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<h4>Assess&nbsp;KPIs&nbsp;and Objectives</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The analysis of KPIs, or&nbsp;<em>Key Performance Indicators</em>, allows you to understand the performance of a marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;with respect to the objectives you set for yourself and allows you to identify areas for improvement.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also&nbsp;allows you to fine-tune and&nbsp;act&nbsp;to&nbsp;correct&nbsp;issues&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here are just some of the main KPIs in Digital Marketing:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Page visits and mobile&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Conversion rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPC or the cost per click</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPL or the cost per lead</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPA or the cost per acquisition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;ROI or the return on investment</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KPIs are essential to understanding&nbsp;whether&nbsp;what you are doing&nbsp;is reaping&nbsp;the desired results or not&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;should,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;be drawn up&nbsp;at least&nbsp;monthly to evaluate&nbsp;whether KPIs&nbsp;align with&nbsp;the efforts and spending&nbsp;of&nbsp;various&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4>Get an overview of all&nbsp;marketing channels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best approach to achieving your marketing objectives is with a multi-channel marketing plan&nbsp;that enables you to&nbsp;interact and engage with your audience successfully regardless of&nbsp;where they are on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because&nbsp;data&nbsp;is often&nbsp;spread across several marketing platforms, multi-channel strategies can be challenging to administer. This issue is lessened by monthly marketing reporting, which combines metrics from several sources&nbsp;and collates&nbsp;them&nbsp;into a single, consolidated report. This&nbsp;means&nbsp;that you can evaluate the impact each channel has on the consumer experience&nbsp;and its&nbsp;effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing&nbsp;reports&nbsp;are a fundamental part of&nbsp;your&nbsp;marketing activities&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;shouldbe&nbsp;collated&nbsp;and available&nbsp;regularly -&nbsp;only&nbsp;then&nbsp;can you make&nbsp;concrete&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;on&nbsp;futureadvertising and communication&nbsp;activities.</p>

<h4>Assess&nbsp;KPIs&nbsp;and Objectives</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The analysis of KPIs, or&nbsp;<em>Key Performance Indicators</em>, allows you to understand the performance of a marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;with respect to the objectives you set for yourself and allows you to identify areas for improvement.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also&nbsp;allows you to fine-tune and&nbsp;act&nbsp;to&nbsp;correct&nbsp;issues&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here are just some of the main KPIs in Digital Marketing:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Page visits and mobile&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Conversion rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPC or the cost per click</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPL or the cost per lead</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;CPA or the cost per acquisition</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;ROI or the return on investment</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KPIs are essential to understanding&nbsp;whether&nbsp;what you are doing&nbsp;is reaping&nbsp;the desired results or not&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital&nbsp;marketing&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;should,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;be drawn up&nbsp;at least&nbsp;monthly to evaluate&nbsp;whether KPIs&nbsp;align with&nbsp;the efforts and spending&nbsp;of&nbsp;various&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;campaigns.</p>

<h4>Get an overview of all&nbsp;marketing channels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best approach to achieving your marketing objectives is with a multi-channel marketing plan&nbsp;that enables you to&nbsp;interact and engage with your audience successfully regardless of&nbsp;where they are on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because&nbsp;data&nbsp;is often&nbsp;spread across several marketing platforms, multi-channel strategies can be challenging to administer. This issue is lessened by monthly marketing reporting, which combines metrics from several sources&nbsp;and collates&nbsp;them&nbsp;into a single, consolidated report. This&nbsp;means&nbsp;that you can evaluate the impact each channel has on the consumer experience&nbsp;and its&nbsp;effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital marketing&nbsp;reports&nbsp;are a fundamental part of&nbsp;your&nbsp;marketing activities&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;shouldbe&nbsp;collated&nbsp;and available&nbsp;regularly -&nbsp;only&nbsp;then&nbsp;can you make&nbsp;concrete&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;on&nbsp;futureadvertising and communication&nbsp;activities.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;well-prepared&nbsp;SEO strategy for the Christmas season could mean the difference between succeeding or&nbsp;falling short&nbsp;of your goals&nbsp;over the festive season. Losing visibility, ranking lower on Google and driving away&nbsp;customers&nbsp;with poor content&nbsp;are&nbsp;the last things you want to happen during&nbsp;one of the busiest&nbsp;online shopping&nbsp;periods of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, we share some essential Christmas SEO optimisation tips to help you tweak your strategy ahead of this year’s Christmas season.</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create useful SEO Christmas content</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll&nbsp;have&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;that&nbsp;offline stores&nbsp;gradually start to adorn themselves in lights and ornaments&nbsp;as early as October to&nbsp;mid-November&nbsp;to get customers in the mood.&nbsp;Online, however, eCommerce&nbsp;retailers&nbsp;often mimic the holiday atmosphere&nbsp;weeks or months&nbsp;in advance&nbsp;by creating&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Content is&nbsp;king”&nbsp;in&nbsp;SEO marketing,&nbsp;and good&nbsp;SEO copywriting aims to produce content that meets the search needs of users and is optimised to be indexed by the Google algorithm and to scale the SERP. Writing new blog articles&nbsp;and&nbsp;promoting your&nbsp;festive&nbsp;products ahead of the&nbsp;2022 Christmas rush&nbsp;can help you climb the search rankings and increase traffic to your website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make use of Google Keyword Planner which can help you nail down what people are looking for so you can tailor your products and content to specific keywords each month. For example “Christmas cards" or even longer, but more specific keywords (long tail keywords) such as "local handmade Christmas cards”. These types of keywords are the ones that will generate the most traffic during the Christmas period.</p>

<h4>Black Friday Digital Marketing Strategies &amp; Tips</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The busiest online shopping weekend of the year is upon us – the Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday rush is among the most important time of the year for online stores. eCommerce and online businesses only have a short window of time to entice shoppers to take advantage of products and great offers from <em>their</em> websites among a dizzying array of competitors and flash deals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this successfully, however, it is necessary, as always, to set up an effective digital marketing strategy for maximising your advertising campaigns in terms of sales and ROAS (Return On Advertising Spend).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's have a look at some eCommerce strategies for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Plan Ahead</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not millions, but billions of promotional emails are sent in the run-up to Black Friday. This is the period when your emails will have to compete with many other brands and cut through the noise to get noticed. To be able to capture the attention of your potential customers you will need to mobilise ahead of time and plan carefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><strong>“Many retailers kick off their Black Friday sales promotion as early as the end of October, while others start promotions in early November.”</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pre-Black Friday is a crucial part of building an audience that is warmed up and prepared to buy when the time comes. Concentrate on those who are familiar with you, follow you, have seen your items, and have engaged with them. At the same time, it is also advisable to carry out a campaign on social networks or increase your ad budget to attract new potential buyers ahead of Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cold selling can be an added expense, especially for businesses with modest budgets. If you want to get noticed, the biggest piece of advice is to act early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Invest In Paid Search And Google Ads</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paid advertising campaigns are an effective eCommerce marketing strategy you can use to attract more customers this Black Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a recent study, almost half of all Black Friday deals are now decided by paid search advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While organic traffic is the best way to rank high on Google and other search engine results pages&nbsp;(SERPs), paid ads can be a game-changer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday eCommerce marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running PPC&nbsp;<em>(Pay Per Click)</em>&nbsp;ads in the days leading up to Black Friday weekend is an excellent marketing tool for increasing online traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Optimise your content and offers</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same goes for the use of keywords in your content. By relying on tools like Google Keyword Planners and Google Trends you can find the keywords to use in the descriptions and content of your site to maximise both the quality and quantity of your traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Content optimisation focuses on addressing issues in the following:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Internal links</li><li>Keywords</li><li>Featured snippets</li><li>URLs</li><li>Readability</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Send an E-Mail With Special Discounts</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although&nbsp;emails&nbsp;are one of the oldest forms of digital marketing, they should still be seen as valid and effective allies. Equally, everyone loves a special offer!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sending your contact list an email promising them a special discount will increase the anticipation when Black Friday arrives and gives them a reason to go and explore your products on offer in the hope of bagging a great deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't make discounts impossible and torturous to understand, however. Try to keep it simple, and be direct and immediate with your wording.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Create a Black Friday landing page</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a landing page within your eCommerce site, entirely dedicated to grouping Black Friday offers is a great way to maintain your positioning within the SERP (the Google search results page) and thus ensures that users can find your products more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating&nbsp;specific content makes&nbsp;it easier for your audience to find you, especially those looking for offers. Make sure you create the page in advance of the big sale so that Googlebot has time to discover and index the page and its products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":4} -->
<h4 class="has-text-align-center">Retrieve abandoned carts with a personalised message and “one-time “offers</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sales naturally fall through the cracks, and a high cart abandonment rate is quite common for online retailers during Black Friday events. Optimising and recovering abandoned carts&nbsp;is and must for any eCommerce business not just during seasonal periods but as a normal part of your marketing strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a customer remarketing campaign can increase the chances of getting customers back to your site and completing the sales journey. Retargeting your visitors with a paid ad campaign allows you to bring them back to your store and back to the point of sale.</p>
